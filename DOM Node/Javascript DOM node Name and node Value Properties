Two properties, nodeName and nodeValue, give specific information about the node.

The values of these properties are completely dependent on the node type.

We need to test the node type before using one of these values, as the following code shows:

Copy
if (someNode.nodeType == 1){
  value = someNode.nodeName;   // will be the element's tag name
}
In this example, the node type is checked to see if the node is an element.

If so, the nodeName value is assigned to a variable.

For elements, nodeName is always equal to the element's tag name, and nodeValue is always null.
