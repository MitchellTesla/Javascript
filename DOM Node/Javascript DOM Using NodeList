NodeList object, NamedNodeMap and HTMLCollection are three important collections in DOM.

Each of these collections is considered "live".

They are updated when the document structure changes so they are always showing the most accurate information.

In reality, all NodeList objects are queries that are run against the DOM document.

Any time you want to iterate over a NodeList, we should initialize a second variable with the length and then compare the iterator to that variable, as shown in the following example:

Copy
let divs = document.getElementsByTagName("div");

for (let i = 0, len = divs.length; i < len; ++i) {
    let div = document.createElement("div");
    document.body.appendChild(div);
}
In this example, a second variable, len, is initialized.

Because len contains a snapshot of divs.length at the time the loop began, it prevents the infinite loop.

Generally speaking, we should limit the number of times you interact with a NodeList.

Because a query is run against the document each time, try to cache frequently used values retrieved from a NodeList.
