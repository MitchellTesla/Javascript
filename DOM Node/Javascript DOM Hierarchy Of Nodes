Any HTML or XML document can be represented as a hierarchy of nodes using the DOM.

There are several node types, each representing different information and/or markup in the document.

Each node type has different characteristics, data, and methods, and each may have relationships with other nodes.

These relationships create a hierarchy that allows markup to be represented as a tree, rooted at a particular node.

For instance, consider the following HTML:

Copy
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Sample Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello World!</p>
  </body>
</html>
This simple HTML document can be represented in a hierarchy, as illustrated in the following tree.

Copy
Document
 |
 +---Element html
      |
      +---Element head
      |    |
      |    +---Element title
      |         |
      |         +---Text Sample Page
      |
      +---Element body
           |
           +---Element p
                |
                +----Text Hello world!
A document node represents every document as the root.

In this example, the only child of the document node is the <html> element, which is called the document element.

The document element is the outermost element in the document within which all other elements exist.

There can be only one document element per document.

In HTML pages, the document element is always the <html> element.

In XML, where there are no predefined elements, any element may be the document element.

Every piece of markup can be represented by a node in the tree:

HTML elements are represented by element nodes,
attributes are represented by attribute nodes,
the document type is represented by a document type node, and
comments are represented by comment nodes.
In total, there are 12 node types, all of which inherit from a base type.
