We can use Node isSameNode() and isEqualNode() to help compare nodes.

Both methods accept a single node as an argument and return true if that node is the same as or equal to the reference node.

Two nodes are the same when they reference the same object.

Two nodes are equal when they are of the same type and have properties that are equal (nodeName, nodeValue, and so on), and their attributes and childNodes properties are equivalent.

Here is an example:

Copy
let div1 = document.createElement("div");
div1.setAttribute("class", "box");

let div2 = document.createElement("div");
div2.setAttribute("class", "box");

console.log(div1.isSameNode(div1));   // true
console.log(div1.isEqualNode(div2));  // true
console.log(div1.isSameNode(div2));   // false
Here, two <div> elements are created with the same attributes.

The two elements are equivalent to one another but are not the same.
