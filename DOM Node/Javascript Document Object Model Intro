The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents.

The DOM represents a document as a hierarchical tree of nodes, allowing developers to add, remove, and modify individual parts of the page.

The DOM is a collection of objects representing the elements in your HTML document.

Evolving out of early Dynamic HTML (DHTML), the DOM is now a truly cross-platform, language-independent way of representing and manipulating pages for markup.

DOM Level 1 became a W3C recommendation in October 1998, providing interfaces for basic document structure and querying.

Given the following html code:

Copy
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <body>
        <p id="myId">
            test<span id="myId2">span</span> 
            test
        </p>
        <p id="LEGO">
            test 
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
As part of the process of displaying your HTML document, the browser parses the HTML and creates a model.

The model preserves the hierarchy of the HTML elements, and each element is represented by a JavaScript object.

You can use the DOM to get information about the document or to make changes to it.

This is the foundation of modern web applications.

Each model object in the model has properties and methods.

When you use these to change the state of the object, the browser reflects the changes in the corresponding HTML element and updates your document.

All of the DOM objects that represent elements support the same set of basic features.
