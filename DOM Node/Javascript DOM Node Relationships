All nodes in a document have relationships to other nodes.

For instance, consider the following HTML:

Copy
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Sample Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello World!</p>
  </body>
</html>
In HTML, the <body> element is a child of the <html> element; likewise the <html> element is the parent of the <body> element.

The <head> element is a sibling of the <body> element, because they both share the same immediate parent, the <html> element.

This simple HTML document can be represented in a hierarchy, as illustrated in the following tree.

Copy
Document
 |
 +---Element html
      |
      +---Element head
      |    |
      |    +---Element title
      |         |
      |         +---Text Sample Page
      |
      +---Element body
           |
           +---Element p
                |
                +----Text Hello world!
