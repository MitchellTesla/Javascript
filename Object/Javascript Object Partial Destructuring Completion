A destructured assignment involving multiple properties is a sequential operation with independent outcomes.

If the initial assignments succeed but a later one throws an error, the destructured assignment will exit having only partially completed:

Copy
let person = {
  name: 'HTML',
  age: 27
 };

let personName, personBar, personAge;
try {
    // person.foo is undefined, so this will throw an error
  ({name: personName, foo: { bar: personBar }, age: personAge} = person);
} catch(e) {}

console.log(personName, personBar, personAge);
// HTML, undefined, undefined
