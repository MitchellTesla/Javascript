Object.create() creates a new object, using its first argument as the prototype of that object:

Copy
let o1 = Object.create({x: 1, y: 2});     // o1 inherits properties x and y.
o1.x + o1.y                               // => 3
You can pass null to create a new object that does not have a prototype, but if you do this, the newly created object will not inherit anything, not even basic methods like toString():

Copy
let o2 = Object.create(null);             // o2 inherits no props or methods.
If you want to create an ordinary empty object, like the object returned by {} or new Object(), pass Object.prototype:

Copy
let o3 = Object.create(Object.prototype); // o3 is like {} or new Object().
