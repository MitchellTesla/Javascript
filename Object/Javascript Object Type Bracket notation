Although object properties are typically accessed using dot notation, which is common to many object-oriented languages, it's also possible to access properties via bracket notation.

When you use bracket notation, a string containing the property name is placed between the brackets, as in this example:

Copy
let person = {
  name: "CSS",
  age: 19
};
console.log(person["name"]);  // "CSS"
console.log(person.name);     // "CSS"
Functionally, there is no difference between the two approaches.

The main advantage of bracket notation is that it allows you to use variables for property access, as in this example:

Copy
let propertyName = "name";
console.log(person[propertyName]);  // "CSS"
You can also use bracket notation when the property name contains characters that would be either a syntax error or a keyword/reserved word. For example:

Copy
person["first name"] = "CSS";
Because the name "first name" contains a space, you can't use dot notation to access it.

The property names can contain non alphanumeric characters-you just need to use bracket notation to access them.

Generally speaking, dot notation is preferred unless variables are necessary to access properties by name.
