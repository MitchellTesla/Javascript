ECMA-262 describes characteristics of properties through the use of internal-only attributes.

These attributes are defined by the specification for implementation in JavaScript engines.

These attributes are not directly accessible in JavaScript.

To indicate that an attribute is internal, surround the attribute name with two pairs of square brackets, such as [[Enumerable]].

There are two types of properties: data properties and accessor properties.
