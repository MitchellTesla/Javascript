We may want to add a variable to an object, and the property name used to key that variable is the variable name itself.

For example:

Copy
let name = 'HTML';

let person = {
  name: name
};

console.log(person);  // { name: 'HTML' }
The property value shorthand convention was introduced.

It allows you to use the variable itself without the colon notation, and the interpreter will automatically use the variable name as the property key.

If the variable name is not found, a ReferenceError will be thrown.

The following code is equivalent:

Copy
let name = 'HTML';

let person = {
  name
};

console.log(person);  // { name: 'HTML' }
