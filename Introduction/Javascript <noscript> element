The <noscript> element was created to provide alternate content for browsers without JavaScript.

This element is useful for browsers that explicitly disable JavaScript.

The <noscript> element can contain any HTML elements, aside from <script>, that can be included in the document <body>.

Any content contained in a <noscript> element will be displayed under only the following two circumstances:

The browser doesn't support scripting.
The browser's scripting support is turned off.
If either of these conditions is met, then the content inside the <noscript> element is rendered. In all other cases, the browser does not render the content of <noscript>.

Here is a simple example:

Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  <title>Example HTML Page</title>
  <script src="example1.js"></script>
  <script src="example2.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  <noscript>
    <p>This page requires a JavaScript-enabled browser.</p>
  </noscript>
  </body>
</html>

In this example, a message is displayed to the user when the scripting is not available.

For scripting-enabled browsers, this message will never be seen even though it is still a part of the page.
