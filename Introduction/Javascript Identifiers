An identifier is the name of a variable, function, property, or function argument.

Identifiers may be one or more characters in the following format:

The first character must be a letter, an underscore _, or a dollar sign $.
All other characters may be letters, underscores, dollar signs, or numbers.
Letters in an identifier may include extended ASCII or Unicode letter characters.

JavaScript identifiers are used to name constants, variables, properties, functions, and classes and to provide labels for certain loops in JavaScript code.

A JavaScript identifier must begin with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).

Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

Digits are not allowed as the first character.

By convention, ECMAScript identifiers use camel case, meaning that the first letter is lowercase and each additional word is offset by a capital letter, like this:

Copy
firstSecondThird
myCarIsGood
doSomethingImportantAnd
These are all legal identifiers:

Copy
x
my_variable_name
v13
_dummy
$string
$$abc
Keywords, reserved words, true, false, and null cannot be used as identifiers.

Copy
let firstSecondThird = 'a';

console.log(firstSecondThird);
Output: a
