ECMAScript's syntax borrows heavily from C and other C-like languages such as Java and Perl.

Javascript is case-sensitive.

The variables, function names, and operators are all case-sensitive.

JavaScript language keywords, variables, function names, and other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.

The while keyword, for example, must be typed "while," not "While" or "WHILE."

A variable named test is different from a variable named Test.

Copy
let test = 'a';
let Test = 'v';

console.log(test);
console.log(Test);
