ECMAScript strict mode is a different parsing and execution model for JavaScript.

To enable strict mode for an entire script, include the following at the top:

Copy
"use strict";
This is a pragma that tells supporting JavaScript engines to change into strict mode.

You may also specify just a function to execute in strict mode by including the pragma at the top of the function body:

Copy
function doSomething() {
  "use strict";
  // function body
}
Strict mode changes how JavaScript is executed. All modern browsers support strict mode.

"use strict" does not include any language keywords: the directive is just an expression statement that consists of a special string literal (in single or double quotes).

"use strict" can appear only at the start of a script or at the start of a function body, before any real statements have appeared.
