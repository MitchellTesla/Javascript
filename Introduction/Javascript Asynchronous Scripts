HTML5 adds the async attribute for <script> elements.

The async attribute changes the way the script is processed.

async applies only to external scripts and signals the browser to begin downloading the file immediately.

Unlike defer, scripts marked as async are not guaranteed to execute in the order in which they are specified. For example:

Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
     <title>Example HTML Page</title>
     <script async src="example1.js"></script>
     <script async src="example2.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
     <!-- content here -->
  </body>
</html>

In this code, the second script file might execute before the first.

There should be no dependencies between the two script files.

For XHTML documents, specify the async attribute as async="async".
