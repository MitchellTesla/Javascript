HTML 4.01 defines an attribute named defer for the <script> element.

defer indicates that a script won't be changing the structure of the page as it executes.

The script can be run safely after the entire page has been parsed.

Setting the defer attribute on a <script> element signals to the browser that download should begin immediately but execution should be deferred:

Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  <title>Example HTML Page</title>
  <script defer src="example1.js"></script>
  <script defer src="example2.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  <!-- content here -->
  </body>
</html>

Note
Even though the two <script> elements are included in the document <head>, they will not be executed until after the browser has received the closing </html> tag.

The defer attribute is supported only for external script files.

Some browsers may ignore this attribute. We should put deferred scripts at the bottom of the page.

For XHTML documents, specify the defer attribute as defer="defer".
