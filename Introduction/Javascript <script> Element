The primary method of inserting JavaScript into an HTML page is via the <script> element.

There are six attributes for the <script> element:

Attribute
Optional
Description
async


Optional


The script should begin downloading immediately.
Should not prevent other actions on the page such as downloading resources or waiting for other scripts to load.
Valid only for external script files.
charset

Optional

The character set of the code specified using the src attribute.
This attribute is rarely used.
crossorigin


Optional


Configures the settings for the associated request.
crossorigin="anonymous" will configure the request for the file to not have the credentials flag set.
crossorigin="use-credentials" will set the credentials flag, meaning the outgoing request will include credentials.
defer

Indicates that the execution of the script can safely be deferred until after the document's content has been completely parsed and displayed.
Valid only for external scripts.
integrity

Optional

If the signature of the retrieved resource does not match that specified by this attribute, the page will error and the script will not execute.
language

Originally indicated the scripting language being used by the code block
src
Optional
Indicates an external file that contains code to be executed.
type


Optional


Replaces language attribute.
indicates the content type, also called MIME type of the scripting language.
If the value is module, the code is treated as an ES6 module and only then is eligible to use the import and export keywords.
