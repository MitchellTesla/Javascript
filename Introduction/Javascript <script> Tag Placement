Traditionally, all <script> elements were placed within the <head> element on a page, as in this example:

Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
         <title>Example HTML Page</title>
         <script src="example1.js"></script>
         <script src="example2.js"></script>
    </head>
<body>
<!-- content here -->
</body>
</html>

Including all JavaScript files in the <head> of a document means that all of the JavaScript code must be downloaded, parsed, and interpreted before the page begins rendering.

The rendering begins when the browser receives the opening <body> tag.

This may cause a noticeable delay in page rendering.

For this reason, modern web applications typically include all JavaScript references in the <body> element, after the page content, as shown in this example:

Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
 <title>Example HTML Page</title>
 </head>
 <body>
 <!-- content here -->
 <!-- content here -->
 <!-- content here -->
 <script src="example1.js"></script>
 <script src="example2.js"></script>
 </body>
</html>


Using this approach, the page is completely rendered in the browser before the JavaScript code is processed.
