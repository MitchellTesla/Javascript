We try out short JavaScript code in a browser with the following steps:

Open up the web developer tools in your web browser (with F12, Ctrl-Shift-I, or Command-Option-I) and
Select the Console tab.
Type code at the prompt
See the results as you type.
Browser developer tools often appear as panes at the bottom or right of the browser window, but you can usually detach them as separate windows, which is often quite convenient.

Node.js
Another way to try out JavaScript code is to download and install Node from https://nodejs.org.

Once Node is installed on your system, you can simply open a Terminal window and type node to begin an interactive JavaScript session like this one:

Copy
$ node

Welcome to Node.js v15.2.1.
Type ".help" for more information.
> .help
.break    Sometimes you get stuck, this gets you out
.clear    Alias for .break
.editor   Enter editor mode
.exit     Exit the REPL
.help     Print this help message
.load     Load JS from a file into the REPL session
.save     Save all evaluated commands in this REPL session to a file

Press Ctrl+C to abort current expression, Ctrl+D to exit the REPL
>
> let x = 2, y = 3;
undefined
> x + y
5
> (x === 2) && (y === 3)
true
> (x > 3) || (y < 3)
false
Hello World
You can write your code in a text editor.

From there, you can copy and paste to the JavaScript console or into a Node session.

Or you can save your code to a file with file name extension .js and then run that file of JavaScript code with Node:

Copy
$ node yourFileName.js
If you use Node in a non interactive manner like this, it won't automatically print out the value of all the code you run.

You can use the function console.log() to display text and other JavaScript values in your terminal window or in a browser's developer tools console.

So, for example, if you create a hello.js file containing this line of code:

Copy
console.log("Hello World!");
and execute the file with node hello.js, you'll see the message "Hello World!" printed out.

If you want to see that same message printed out in the JavaScript console of a web browser, create a new file named hello.html, and put this text in it:

Copy
<script src="hello.js"></script>
Then load hello.html into your web browser using a file:// URL like this one:

Copy
file:///Users/username/javascript/hello.html
Open the developer tools window to see the greeting in the console.

You can drag and drop your html file to browser.
