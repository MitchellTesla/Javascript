ECMAScript uses C-style comments for both single-line and block comments.

A single-line comment begins with two forward-slash characters, such as this:

Copy
// single line comment
A block comment begins with a forward slash and asterisk (/*) and ends with the opposite (*/), as in this example:

Copy
/* This is a multi-line
comment */
Example
The following code adds some comments to a simple script.

Copy
//This is a test file

let a= 'a';

/*
  The following code output message to console
*/
console.log(a);
Output:

a
