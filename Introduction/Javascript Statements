Statements in ECMAScript are terminated by a semicolon.

Omitting the semicolon makes the parser determine where the end of a statement occurs.

Copy
let sum = a + b    // valid even without a semicolon - not recommended
let diff = a - b;  // valid - preferred
Even though a semicolon is not required at the end of statements, you should always include one.

Including semicolons helps prevent errors of omission.

Including semicolons also improves performance in certain situations.

Multiple statements can be combined into a code block by using C-style syntax, beginning with a left curly brace { and ending with a right curly brace }:

Copy
let test = true;

if (test) {
  test = false;
  console.log(test);
}
Control statements, such as if, require code blocks only when executing multiple statements.

It is a best practice to always use code blocks with control statements, even if there's only one statement to be executed:

Copy
let test = true;

// valid, but error-prone and should be avoided
if (test)
   console.log(test);

// preferred
if (test) {
    console.log(test);
}
Using code blocks for control statements makes the intent clearer, and there's less chance for errors when changes need to be made.
