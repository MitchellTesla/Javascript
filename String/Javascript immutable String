Strings are immutable in ECMAScript, and once they are created, their values cannot change.

To change the string held by a variable, the original string must be destroyed and the variable filled with another string containing a new value, like this:

Copy
let lang = "Java";
lang = lang + "Script";
Here, the variable lang is defined to contain the string "Java".

On the next line, lang is redefined to combine "Java" with "Script", making its value "JavaScript".

The last step in the process is to destroy the original string "Java" and the string "Script", because neither is necessary anymore.

All of this happens behind the scenes.
