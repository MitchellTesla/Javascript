String split() separates the string into an array of substrings based on a separator.

The separator may be a string or a RegExp object.

The string is not converted to a regular expression for this method.

An optional second argument, the array limit, ensures that the returned array will be no larger than a certain size.

Consider this example:

Copy
let sText = "A,B,C,D,E";
let s1 = sText.split(",");       
let s2 = sText.split(",", 2);    
let s3 = sText.split(/[^\,]+/);  
console.log(s1);
console.log(s2);
console.log(s3);
Output:


In this example, the string sText is a comma-separated string of letters.

The call to split(",") retrieves an array of those letters, splitting the string on the comma character.

To truncate the results to only two items, a second argument of 2 is specified.

Last, using a regular expression, it's possible to get an array of the comma characters.
