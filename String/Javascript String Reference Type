The String type is the object representation for strings and is created using the String constructor as follows:

Copy
let stringObject = new String("hi");
The methods of a String object are available on all string primitives.

All three of the inherited methods-valueOf(), toLocaleString(), and toString()-return the object's primitive string value.

Each instance of String contains a single property, length, which indicates the number of characters in the string.

Consider the following example:

Copy
let stringValue = "hello world";
console.log(stringValue.length);   // "11"
This example outputs "11", the number of characters in "hello world".

Note that even if the string contains a double-byte character, each character is still counted as one.

The String type has a large number of methods to aid in the dissection and manipulation of strings in ECMAScript.
