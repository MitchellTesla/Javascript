All types of values have Boolean equivalents in ECMAScript.

To convert a value into its Boolean equivalent, the special Boolean() casting function is called, like this:

Copy
let message = "hi!";
let messageAsBoolean = Boolean(message);
In this example, the string message is converted into a Boolean value and stored in messageAsBoolean.

The Boolean() casting function can be called on any type of data and will always return a Boolean value.

The rules for when a value is converted to true or false depend on the data type as much as the actual value.

The following table outlines the various data types and their specific conversions.

Data Type
Values Converted To True
Values Converted To False
Boolean
true
false
String
Any nonempty string
"" (empty string)
Number

Any nonzero number
(including infinity)
0, NaN

Object
Any object
null
Undefined
n/a
undefined
The flow-control statements, such as the if statement, automatically perform this Boolean conversion, as shown here:

Copy
let message = "hi!";
if (message) {
  console.log("Value is true");
}
In this example, the console.log will be displayed because the string message is automatically converted into its Boolean equivalent (true).

It's important to understand what variable you're using in a flow-control statement because of this automatic conversion.
