ECMAScript variables has two different types of data: primitive values and reference values.

Primitive values
Primitive values are simple atomic pieces of data, while reference values are objects that may be made up of multiple values.

When a value is assigned to a variable, the JavaScript engine must determine if it's a primitive or a reference value.

The six primitive types are:

undefined,
null,
Boolean,
Number,
String, and
Symbol.
These variables are accessed by value, because you are manipulating the actual value stored in the variable.

Reference values
Reference values are objects stored in memory.

JavaScript does not permit direct access of memory locations, so direct manipulation of the object's memory space is not allowed.

When you manipulate an object, you're really working on a reference to that object rather than the actual object itself.

For this reason, such values are said to be accessed by reference.
