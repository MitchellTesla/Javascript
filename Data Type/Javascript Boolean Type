The Boolean type has only two literal values: true and false.

These values are distinct from numeric values, so true is not equal to 1, and false is not equal to 0.

Assignment of Boolean values to variables is as follows:

Copy
let found = true;
let lost = false;
The Boolean literals true and false are case-sensitive, so True and False are valid as identifiers but not as Boolean values.
