The following code shows some of the keyboard events in use.

Copy
let inputElems = document.getElementsByTagName("input");
for (let i = 0; i < inputElems.length; i++) {
    inputElems[i].onkeyup = handleKeyboardEvent;
}

function handleKeyboardEvent(e) {
    document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "Key pressed: " +
        e.keyCode + " Char: " + String.fromCharCode(e.keyCode);
}

The script in this example changes the content of a span element to display key strokes sent to a pair of input elements.

Notice how we use the String.fromCharCode function to convert the value of the keyCode property into a more useful value.
