Browsers offer a method called getBoundingClientRect() on each element, which returns a DOMRect object that has six properties: left, top, right, bottom, height, and width.

These properties give the location of the element on the page relative to the viewport.

Copy
let myDiv = document.getElementById("myDiv");
let rect = myDiv.getBoundingClientRect();
console.log(rect);
