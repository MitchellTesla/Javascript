The NamedNodeMap type introduces the following methods for dealing with namespaces.

Because attributes are represented by a NamedNodeMap, these methods mostly apply to attributes.

Method
Meaning
getNamedItemNS(namespaceURI, localName)
Gets the item from the namespace represented by namespaceURI and with a name of localName.
removeNamedItemNS(namespaceURI, localName)
Removes the item from the namespace represented by namespaceURI and with a name of localName.
setNamedItemNS(node)
Adds node, which should have namespace information already applied.
These methods are rarely used because attributes are typically accessed directly from an element.
