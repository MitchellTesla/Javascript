New elements can be created by using the document.createElement() method.

This method accepts a single argument, which is the tag name of the element to create.

In HTML documents, the tag name is case-insensitive, whereas it is case-sensitive in XML and XHTML documents.

To create a <div> element, the following code can be used:

Copy
let div = document.createElement("div");
Using the createElement() method creates a new element and sets its ownerDocument property.

At this point, you can manipulate the element's attributes, add more children to it, and so on.

Consider the following example:

Copy
div.id = "myNewDiv";
div.className = "box";
Because the element is not part of the document tree, it doesn't affect the browser's display.

The element can be added to the document tree using appendChild(), insertBefore(), or replaceChild().

The following code adds the newly created element to the document's <body> element:

Copy
document.body.appendChild(div);
Once the element has been added to the document tree, the browser renders it immediately.

Any changes to the element after this point are immediately reflected by the browser.
