When moving elements from one part of the document to another, you simply need to associate the element you want to move with its new parent.

You don't need to dislocate the element from its starting position.

The following code provides a demonstration by moving a row from one table to another.

Moving Elements.

Copy
document.getElementById("move").onclick = function() {
    let elem = document.getElementById("apple");
    document.getElementById("fruitsBody").appendChild(elem);
};

When the <button> element is pressed, the script moves the <tr> element with the id of apple and calls the appendChild() element on the <tbody> element with the id of fruitsBody.

This has the effect of moving the row from one table to another.
