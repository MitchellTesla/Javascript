Iframe is represented by HTMLIFrameElement.

It has a contentDocument property that contains a pointer to the document object representing the contents of the iframe.

This property can be used, as shown in the following example:

Copy
let iframe = document.getElementById("myIframe");
let iframeDoc = iframe.contentDocument;
The contentDocument property is an instance of Document and can be used just like any other HTML document, including all properties and methods.

There is a property called contentWindow that returns the window object for the frame, which has a document property.

The contentDocument and contentWindow properties are available in all modern browsers.

Access to the document object of an iframe is limited based on cross domain security restrictions.

If you are trying to access the document object of an iframe containing a page from a different domain or sub domain, or with a different protocol, you get an error.
