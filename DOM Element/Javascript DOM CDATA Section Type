CDATA sections are specific to XML-based documents and are represented by the CDATASection type.

The CDATASection type inherits from the base Text type, so it has all of the same string manipulation methods except for splitText().

A CDATASection node has the following characteristics:

Item
Value
nodeType
4
nodeName
#cdata-section
nodeValue
the contents of the CDATA section.
parentNode
a Document or Element.
Child nodes
not supported.
CDATA sections are valid only in XML documents, so most browsers will incorrectly parse a CDATA section into either a Comment or an Element.

Consider the following:

Copy
<div id="myDiv"><![CDATA[This is some content.]]></div>
In this example, a CDATASection node should exist as the first child of the <div>; however, none of the four major browsers interpret it as such.

Even in valid XHTML pages, the browsers don't properly support embedded CDATA sections.

True XML documents allow the creation of CDATA sections using document.createCDataSection() and pass in the node's content.
