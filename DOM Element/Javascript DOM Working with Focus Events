Using the Focus Events.

Copy
let inputElems = document.getElementsByTagName("input");
for (let i = 0; i < inputElems.length; i++) {
    inputElems[i].onfocus = handleFocusEvent;
    inputElems[i].onblur = handleFocusEvent;
}

function handleFocusEvent(e) {
    if (e.type == "focus") {
        e.target.style.backgroundColor = "lightgray";
        e.target.style.border = "thick double red";
    } else {
        e.target.style.removeProperty("background-color");
        e.target.style.removeProperty("border");
    }
}

The script in this example uses the focus and blur events to change the style of a pair of input elements.
