The client dimensions of an element comprise the space occupied by the element's content and its padding.

There are only two properties related to client dimensions: clientWidth and clientHeight.

The clientWidth property is the width of the content area plus the width of both the left and the right padding.

The clientHeight property is the height of the content area plus the height of both the top and the bottom padding.

The client dimensions are the amount of space inside of the element, so the space taken up by scrollbars is not counted.

The most common use of these properties is to determine the browser viewport size.

This is done by using the clientWidth and clientHeight of document.documentElement.

These properties represent the dimensions of the viewport which is the <html> or <body> elements.

The client dimensions are read-only and are calculated each time they are accessed.
