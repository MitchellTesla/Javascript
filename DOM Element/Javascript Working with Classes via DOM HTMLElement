You can deal with the classes that an element belongs to in two ways.

The first is to use the className property, which returns a list of the classes.

You add or remove classes by changing the value of the string.

You can see both reading and modifying the classes in the following code.

A common use for classes is to target elements with styles.

Using the className Property.

Copy
document.getElementById("pressme").onclick = function(e) {
    document.getElementById("textblock").className += " newclass";
};

In this example, clicking the button triggers the script, which appends a new class to the list for the element.

Notice that we need to add a leading space to the value we appended to the className property value.

This is because the browser expects a list of classes, each separated by a space.

The browser will apply styles whose selectors are class-based when we make a change like this.
