We can determine node relationships using the compareDocumentPosition() method.

This method determines the relationship between two nodes and returns a bit mask indicating the relationship.

The values for the bit mask are as shown in the following table.

Mask
Relationship Between Nodes
Meaning
0x1
Disconnected
The passed-in node is not in the document.
0x2
Precedes
The passed-in node appears in the DOM tree prior to the reference node.
0x4
Follows
The passed-in node appears in the DOM tree after the reference node.
0x8
Contains
The passed-in node is an ancestor of the reference node.
0x10
Is contained by
The passed-in node is a descendant of the reference node.
The result of compareDocumentPosition() can be bitwise ANDed to determine if the reference node contains the given node.

Here is an example:

Copy
let result = document.documentElement.compareDocumentPosition(document.body);
console.log(!!(result & 0x10));
When this code is executed, result becomes 20, or 0x14 (0x4 for "follows" plus 0x10 for "is contained by").

Applying a bitwise mask of 0x10 to the result returns a nonzero number, and the two NOT operators convert that value into a Boolean.

All modern browsers support compareDocumentPosition.
