The text content of an element is represented by a Text object, which is presented as a child of the element in the document model.

The following code shows an element with some text content.

Copy
...
<p>
    test
</p>
...
When the browser represents the <p> element in the document model, there will be an HTMLElement object for the element itself and a Text object for the content.

Copy
P element
 |
 +--text
If an element has children and they contain text, each will be handled in the same way.

The following code adds an element to the paragraph.

Adding an Element to the Paragraph.

Copy
...
<p>
   test<b>500</b> test
</p>
...
The addition of the <b> element changes the hierarchy of nodes used to represent the <p> element and its contents.

Copy
P
 |
 +--text
 |
 +--b
 |  |
 |  +-text
 |
 +--text
The first child of the <p> element is a <Text> object that represents the text from the start of the block to the <b> element.

Then there is the <b> element, which has its own child Text object representing the text contained between the start and end tags.

Finally, the last child of the <p> element is a Text object representing the text that follows the b element through to the end of the block.

The following table describes the members supported by the Text object.

The following code shows some of the Text element methods and properties in use.

Dealing with Text.

Copy
let results = document.getElementById("results");
let elem = document.getElementById("textblock");

document.getElementById("pressme").onclick = function() {
    let textElem = elem.firstChild;
    results.innerHTML = "The element has " +
           textElem.length + " chars\n";

};

An important point to note when working with text is that whitespace is not collapsed.

This means that any spaces or other whitespace characters that have been used to add structure to the HTML are counted as part of the text.
