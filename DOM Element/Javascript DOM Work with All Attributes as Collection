You can obtain a collection containing all of the attributes for an element through the attributes property, which returns an array of Attr objects.

The properties of the Attr object are described in the following table.

Properties
Description
Returns
name
Returns the name of the attribute
string
value
Gets or sets the value of the attribute
string
The following code shows how to use the attributes property and the Attr object to read and modify an element's attributes.

Working with the attributes Property.

Copy
let results = document.getElementById("results");
let elem = document.getElementById("textblock");

let attrs = elem.attributes;

for (let i = 0; i < attrs.length; i++) {
    results.innerHTML += "Name: " + attrs[i].name + " Value: "
        + attrs[i].value + "\n";
}

attrs["data-yourdata"].value = "banana";

results.innerHTML += "Value of data-yourdata attr: "
    + attrs["data-yourdata"].value;

As you can see from the listing, the attributes in the array of Attr objects are indexed by position and name.

In this example, we enumerate the names and values of the attributes applied to an element, and then modify the value of one of them.
