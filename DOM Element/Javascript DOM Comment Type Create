Comment nodes can be created using the document.createComment() method and passing in the comment text, as shown in the following code:

Copy
let comment = document.createComment("A comment");
Browsers don't recognize comments that exist after the closing </html> tag.

If you need to access comment nodes, make sure they appear as descendants of the <html> element.
