HTML5 adds functionality to aid with focus management in the DOM.

The first is document.activeElement, which always contains a pointer to the DOM element that currently has focus.

An element can receive focus automatically as the page is loading, via user input, or programmatically using the focus() method.

For example:

Copy
let button = document.getElementById("myButton");
button.focus();
console.log(document.activeElement === button);  // true
By default, document.activeElement is set to document.body when the document is first loaded.

Before the document is fully loaded, document.activeElement is null.

The document.hasFocus() returns a Boolean value indicating if the document has focus:

Copy
let button = document.getElementById("myButton");
button.focus();
console.log(document.hasFocus());  // true
Determining if the document has focus allows you to determine if the user is interacting with the page.
