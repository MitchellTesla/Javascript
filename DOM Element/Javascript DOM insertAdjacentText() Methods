The insertAdjacentText() methods accept two arguments:

the position in which to insert and
the HTML or text to insert.
The first argument must be one of the following values:

Value
Meaning
"beforebegin"
Insert just before the element as a previous sibling.
"afterbegin"
Insert just inside of the element as a new child or series of children before the first child.
"beforeend"
Insert just inside of the element as a new child or series of children after the last child.
"afterend"
Insert just after the element as a next sibling.
Note that each of these values is case insensitive.

The second argument is parsed as an HTML string or as a raw string and in the case of HTML, will throw an error if the value cannot be properly parsed.

Basic usage is as follows.

Insert as previous sibling.

Copy
element.insertAdjacentHTML("beforebegin", "<p>Hello world!</p>");
element.insertAdjacentText("beforebegin", "Hello world!");
Insert as first child.

Copy
element.insertAdjacentHTML("afterbegin", "<p>Hello world!</p>");
element.insertAdjacentText("afterbegin", "Hello world!");
Insert as last child.

Copy
element.insertAdjacentHTML("beforeend", "<p>Hello world!</p>");
element.insertAdjacentText("beforeend", "Hello world!");
Insert as next sibling.

Copy
element.insertAdjacentHTML("afterend", "<p>Hello world!</p>"); element.
insertAdjacentText("afterend", "Hello world!");
