Text nodes are represented by the Text type and contain plain text that is interpreted literally and may contain escaped HTML characters but no HTML code.

A Text node has the following characteristics:

Item
Description
nodeType
3
nodeName
#text
nodeValue
text contained in the node.
parentNode
an Element
Child nodes
not supported.
The text contained in a Text node may be accessed via either the nodeValue property or the data property, both of which contain the same value.

Changes to either nodeValue or data are reflected in the other as well.

The following methods allow for manipulation of the text in the node:

Method
Description
appendData(text)
Appends text to the end of the node.
deleteData(offset, count)
Deletes count number of characters starting at position offset.
insertData(offset, text)
Inserts text at position offset.
replaceData(offset, count, text)
Replaces the text starting at offset through offset + count with text.
splitText(offset)
Splits the text node into two text nodes separated at position offset.
substringData(offset, count)
Extracts a string from the text beginning at position offset and continuing until offset + count.
In addition to these methods, the length property returns the number of characters in the node.

This value is the same as using nodeValue.length or data.length.

By default, every element that may contain content will have at most one text node when content is present.

Here is an example.

No content, so no text node:

Copy
<div></div>
White space content, so one text node

Copy
<div> </div>
Content, so one text node

Copy
<div>Hello World!</div>
The first <div> element in this code has no content, so there is no text node.

The second <div> element has a single text node as a child even though its content is white space.

The text node's nodeValue is a single space.

The third <div> also has a single text node whose nodeValue is "Hello World!".

The following code lets you access this node:

Copy
let textNode = div.firstChild;  // or div.childNodes[0]
Once a reference to the text node is retrieved, it can be changed like this:

Copy
div.firstChild.nodeValue = "Some other message";
As long as the node is currently in the document tree, the changes to the text node will be reflected immediately.

The string is HTML- or XML-encoded depending on the type of document.

Any less-than symbols, greater-than symbols, or quotation marks are escaped, as shown in this example:

Copy
div.firstChild.nodeValue = "Some <strong>hi</strong> message";
will output

Copy
Some &lt;strong&gt;hi&lt;/strong&gt; message
