HTML5 supports custom attributes that are prefixed with data-, such as data-mycustomattribute.

You can work with these custom attributes in the DOM via the dataset property, which returns an array of values, indexed by the custom part of the name.

Using the dataset Property.

Copy
let results = document.getElementById("results");
let elem = document.getElementById("textblock");

for (let attr in elem.dataset) {
    results.innerHTML += attr + "\n";
}

results.innerHTML += "Value of data-yourdata attr: " +
   elem.dataset["yourdata"];

The array of values that the dataset property returns isn't indexed by position as in regular arrays.

If you want to enumerate the data-* attributes, you can do so using a for...in statement.

Alternatively, you can request a value by name.

Note that you need to provide only the custom part of the attribute name.

For example, if you want the value of the data-yourData attribute, you request the value dataset["yourData"].
