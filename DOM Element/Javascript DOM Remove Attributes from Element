The method removeAttribute() removes the attribute from the element altogether.

This does more than just clear the attribute's value; it completely removes the attribute from the element.

Consider the following HTML element:

Copy
<div id="myDiv" class="bd" title="asdf" lang="en" dir="ltr"></div>
Here's an example:

Copy
let div = document.getElementById("myDiv");
div.removeAttribute("class");
This method isn't used very frequently, but it can be useful for specifying exactly which attributes to include when serializing a DOM element.
