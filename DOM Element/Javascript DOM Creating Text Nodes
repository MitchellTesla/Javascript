New text nodes can be created using the document.createTextNode() method, which accepts text as its only argument.

The text will be HTML- or XML-encoded, as shown in this example:

Copy
let textNode = document.createTextNode("<strong>Hello</strong> world!");
When a new text node is created, its ownerDocument property is set, but it does not appear in the browser window until it is added to a node in the document tree.

The following code creates a new <div> element and adds a text to it:

Copy
let element = document.createElement("div");
element.className = "message";

let textNode = document.createTextNode("Hello world!");
element.appendChild(textNode);

document.body.appendChild(element);
This example creates a new <div> element and assigns it a class of "message".

Then a text node is created and added to that element.

The last step is to add the element to the document's body, which makes both the element and the text node appear in the browser.

Typically, elements have only one text node as a child.

However, it is possible to have multiple text nodes as children, as this example demonstrates:

Copy
let element = document.createElement("div");
element.className = "message";

let textNode = document.createTextNode("Hello world!");
element.appendChild(textNode);

let anotherTextNode = document.createTextNode("Yippee!");
element.appendChild(anotherTextNode);

document.body.appendChild(element);
When a text node is added as a sibling of another text node, the text in those nodes is displayed without any space between them.
