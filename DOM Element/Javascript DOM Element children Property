The children property is an HTMLCollection that contains only an element's child nodes that are also elements.

Otherwise, the children property is the same as childNodes and may contain the same items when an element has only elements as children.

The children property is accessed as follows:

Copy
let childCount = element.children.length;
let firstChild = element.children[0];
