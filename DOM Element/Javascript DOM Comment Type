Comments are represented in the DOM by the Comment type.

A Comment node has the following characteristics:

Item
Value
nodeType
8
nodeName
#comment
nodeValue
the content of the comment
parentNode
a Document or Element.
Child nodes
not supported.
The Comment type inherits from the same base as the Text type, so it has all of the same string manipulation methods except splitText().

The actual content of the comment may be retrieved using either nodeValue or the data property.

A comment node can be accessed as a child node from its parent.

Consider the following HTML code:

Copy
<div id="myDiv"><!-- A comment --></div>
In the example above, the comment is a child node of the <div> element, which means it can be accessed like this:

Copy
let div = document.getElementById("myDiv");
let comment = div.firstChild;
console.log(comment.data);  // "A comment"
