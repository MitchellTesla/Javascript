To retrieve the Global object is to use the following code:

Copy
abc = 'a';
let global = function() {
  return this;
}();

console.log(abc);
Output:


This code creates an immediately-invoked function expression that returns the value of this.

The this value is equivalent to the Global object when a function is executed with no explicit this value specified either by being an object method or via call()/apply().

Thus, calling a function that simply returns this is a consistent way to retrieve the Global object in any execution environment.
