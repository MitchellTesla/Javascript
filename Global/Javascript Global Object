The Global object is the most unique in ECMAScript because it isn't explicitly accessible.

ECMA-262 specifies the Global object as a catch all for properties and methods that don't otherwise have an owning object.

In Javascript, there is no global variables or global functions. All variables and functions defined globally become properties of the Global object.

Functions such as isNaN(), isFinite(), parseInt(), and parseFloat(), are actually methods of the Global object.

Global object also has methods for encoding and decoding URL. It also has an eval function.
