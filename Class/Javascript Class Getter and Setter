Class definitions also support getters and setter accessors.

The syntax and behavior is identical to that of regular objects:

Copy
class Person {
   set name(newName) {
     this.name_ = newName;
   }
  
   get name() {
     return this.name_;
   }
}

let p = new Person();

p.name = 'CSS';
console.log(p.name);  // CSS
