A class can be composed of the class's constructor method, instance methods, getters, setters, and static class methods.

None of these are explicitly required.

By default, everything inside a class definition executes in strict mode.

We should capitalize the class name to distinguish it from instances that are created from it.

For example, class Foo {} might create an instance foo.

Valid empty class definition

Copy
class Foo {}
Valid class definition with constructor

Copy
class Bar {
  constructor() {}
}
Valid class definition with getter

Copy
class Baz {
  get myBaz() {}
}
Valid class definition with static method

Copy
class Qux {
  static myQux() {}
}
Class expressions
Class expressions may be optionally named.

When the expression is assigned to a variable, the name property may be used to retrieve the class expression name string, but the identifier itself is not accessible outside the class expression scope.

Copy
let Person = class PersonName {
  identify() {
    console.log(Person.name, PersonName.name);
  }
}

let p = new Person();

p.identify();              // PersonName, PersonName

console.log(Person.name);  // PersonName
console.log(PersonName);   // ReferenceError: PersonName is not defined
