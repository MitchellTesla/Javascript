We can construct a string with a different separator using the join() method.

The join() method accepts one argument, which is the string separator to use, and returns a string containing all items.

Consider this example:

Copy
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
console.log(colors.join(","));    // red,green,blue
console.log(colors.join("||"));   // red||green||blue
Here, the join() method is used on the colors array to duplicate the output of toString().

By passing in a comma, the result is a comma-separated list of values.

On the last line, double pipes are passed in, resulting in the string "red||green||blue".

If no value or undefined is passed into the join() method, then a comma is used as the separator.

If an item in the array is null or undefined, it is represented by an empty string in the result of join(), toLocaleString(), toString(), and valueOf().
