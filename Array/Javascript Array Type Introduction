An ECMAScript array is very different from arrays in most other programming languages.

ECMAScript arrays are ordered lists of data, and they can hold any type of data in each slot.

We can create an array that has a string in the first position, a number in the second, an object in the third, and so on.

ECMAScript arrays are also dynamically sized, automatically growing to accommodate any data that is added to them.
