To get and set array values, you use square brackets and provide the zero-based numeric index of the value, as shown here:

Copy
let colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];  // define an array of strings
console.log(colors[0]);                 // display the first item
colors[2] = "black";                    // change the third item
colors[3] = "brown";                    // add a fourth item
The index within the square brackets indicates the value being accessed.

If the index is less than the number of items in the array, then it will return the value stored in the corresponding item, as colors[0] displays "red" in this example.

Setting a value replacing the value in the designated position.

If a value is set to an index that is past the end of the array, as with colors[3] in this example, the array length is automatically expanded to be that index plus 1.
