You access an element of an array using the [] operator.

A reference to the array should appear to the left of the brackets.

An arbitrary expression that has a non-negative integer value should be inside the brackets.

You can use this syntax to both read and write the value of an element of an array.

Thus, the following are all legal JavaScript statements:

Copy
let a = ["world"];     // Start with a one-element array
let value = a[0];      // Read element 0
a[1] = 3.14;           // Write element 1
let i = 2;
a[i] = 3;              // Write element 2
a[i + 1] = "hello";    // Write element 3
a[a[i]] = a[0];        // Read elements 0 and 2, write element 3
Array maintains the value of the length property for you.

In the preceding, for example, we created an array a with a single element.

We then assigned values at indexes 1, 2, and 3.

The length property of the array changed as we did, so:

Copy
a.length       // => 4
