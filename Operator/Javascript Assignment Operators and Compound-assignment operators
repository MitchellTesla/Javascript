Simple assignment is done with the equal sign (=) and assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left, as shown in the following example:

Copy
let num = 10;
Compound assignment is done with one of the multiplicative, additive, or bitwise-shift operators followed by an equal sign (=).

These assignments are designed as shorthand for such common situations as this:

Copy
let num = 10;
num = num + 10;
The second line of code can be replaced with a compound assignment:

Copy
let num = 10;
num += 10;
Compound-assignment operators exist for each of the major mathematical operations and a few others as well.

They are as follows:

Operation	Compound-assignment operators
Multiply/assign	*=
Divide/assign	/=
Modulus/assign	%=
Add/assign	+=
Subtract/assign	-=
Left shift/assign	<<=
Signed right shift/assign	>>=
Unsigned right shift/assign	>>>=

+=
a += b
a = a + b
-=
a -= b
a = a - b
*=
a *= b
a = a * b
/=
a /= b
a = a / b
%=
a %= b
a = a % b
**=
a **= b
a = a ** b
<<=
a <<= b
a = a << b
>>=
a >>= b
a = a >> b
>>>=
a >>>= b
a = a >>> b
&=
a &= b
a = a & b
|=
a |= b
a = a | b
^=
a ^= b
a = a ^ b
These operators are designed specifically as shorthand ways of achieving operations.
