The conditional operator in ECMAScript takes on the same form as in Java, which is as follows:

Copy
variable = boolean_expression ? true_value : false_value;
This basically allows a conditional assignment to a variable depending on the evaluation of the boolean_expression.

If it's true, then true_value is assigned to the variable; if it's false, then false_value is assigned to the variable, as in this instance:

Copy
let max = (num1 > num2) ? num1 : num2;
In this example, max is to be assigned the number with the highest value.

The expression states that if num1 is greater than num2, then num1 is assigned to max.

If, however, the expression is false, then num2 is assigned to max.

Example
Here is a typical usage, which checks to be sure that a variable is defined and has a meaningful, truthy value, and uses it if so or provides a default value if not:

Copy
greeting = "hello " + (username ? username  : "there");
This is equivalent to, but more compact than, the following if statement:

Copy
greeting = "hello ";
if (username) {
         greeting += username;
} else {
         greeting += "there";
}
