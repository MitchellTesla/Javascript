The in operator expects a left-side operand that is a string, symbol, or value that can be converted to a string.

It expects a right-side operand that is an object.

It evaluates to true if the left-side value is the name of a property of the right-side object.

For example:

Copy
let point = {x: 1, y: 1};  // Define an object
"x" in point               // => true: object has property named "x"
"z" in point               // => false: object has no "z" property.
"toString" in point        // => true: object inherits toString method

let data = [7,8,9];        // An array with elements (indices) 0, 1, and 2
"0" in data                // => true: array has an element "0"
1 in data                  // => true: numbers are converted to strings
3 in data
