The modulus (remainder) operator is represented by a percent sign (%) and is used in the following way:

Copy
let result = 26 % 5;  // equal to 1
The modulus operator behaves differently for special values, as follows:

If the operands are numbers, regular arithmetic division is performed, and the remainder of that division is returned.
If the dividend is an infinite number and the divisor is a finite number, the result is NaN.
If the dividend is a finite number and the divisor is 0, the result is NaN.
If Infinity is divided by Infinity, the result is NaN.
If the dividend is a finite number and the divisor is an infinite number, then the result is the dividend.
If the dividend is zero and the divisor is nonzero, the result is zero.
If either operand isn't a number, it is converted to a number behind the scenes using Number() and then the other rules are applied.
