New in ECMAScript 7, Math.pow() now gets its own ** operator, which behaves identically.

Copy
console.log(Math.pow(3, 2);     // 9
console.log(3 ** 2);            // 9

console.log(Math.pow(16, 0.5);  // 4
console.log(16** 0.5);          // 4
The operator also gets its own exponentiate assignment operator, **=, which performs the exponentiation and subsequent assignment of the result:

Copy
let squared = 3;
squared **= 2;
console.log(squared);  // 9

let sqrt = 16;
sqrt **= 0.5;
console.log(sqrt);     // 4
