The divide operator is represented by a slash (/) and divides the first operand by the second operand, as shown here:

Copy
let result = 60 / 10;
The divide operator has special behaviors for special values. They are as follows:

If the operands are numbers, regular arithmetic division is performed. If the result can't be represented in ECMAScript, it returns either Infinity or -Infinity.
If either operand is NaN, the result is NaN.
If Infinity is divided by Infinity, the result is NaN.
If zero is divided by zero, the result is NaN.
If a nonzero finite number is divided by zero, the result is either Infinity or -Infinity, depending on the sign of the first operand.
If Infinity is divided by any number, the result is either Infinity or -Infinity, depending on the sign of the second operand.
If either operand isn't a number, it is converted to a number behind the scenes using Number() and then the other rules are applied.
