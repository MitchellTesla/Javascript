The multiply operator is represented by an asterisk (*) and is used, as one might suspect, to multiply two numbers.

The syntax is the same as in C, as shown here:

Copy
let result = 3 * 5;
The multiply operator has the following unique behaviors when dealing with special values:

If the operands are numbers, regular arithmetic multiplication is performed. If the result cannot be represented by ECMAScript, either Infinity or -Infinity is returned.
If either operand is NaN, the result is NaN.
If Infinity is multiplied by 0, the result is NaN.
If Infinity is multiplied by any finite number other than 0, the result is either Infinity or -Infinity, depending on the sign of the second operand.
If Infinity is multiplied by Infinity, the result is Infinity.
If either operand isn't a number, it is converted to a number behind the scenes using Number() and then the other rules are applied.
