ECMA-262 describes a set of operators that can be used to manipulate data values.

The operators range from mathematical operations, such as addition and subtraction, and bitwise operators to relational operators and equality operators.

Operators in ECMAScript can be used on a wide range of values, including strings, numbers, Booleans, and even objects.

When used on objects, operators typically call the valueOf() and/or toString() method to retrieve a value they can work with.

Unary Operators
Operators that work on only one value are called unary operators. They are the simplest operators in ECMAScript.
