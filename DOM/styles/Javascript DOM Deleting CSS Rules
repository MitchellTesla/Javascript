We can delete rules from a style sheet using deleteRule() method, which accepts a single argument: the index of the rule to remove.

To remove the first rule in a style sheet, you can use the following code:

Copy
sheet.deleteRule(0);  // DOM method
Deleting rules can affect the cascading effect of CSS.
