We can add new rules to existing style sheets using the insertRule() method.

This method expects two arguments: the text of the rule and the index at which to insert the rule.

Here is an example:

Copy
sheet.insertRule("body { background-color: silver }", 0);  // DOM method
This example inserts a rule that changes the document's background color.

The rule is inserted as the first rule in the style sheet (position 0).

The order is important in determining how the rule cascades into the document.
