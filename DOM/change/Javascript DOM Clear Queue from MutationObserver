We can clear a MutationObserver's record queue with the takeRecords() method.

This will return the array of MutationRecord instances which exist in the queue, and empty the queue itself.

This is demonstrated here:

Copy
let observer = new MutationObserver(
(mutationRecords) => console.log(mutationRecords));

observer.observe(document.body, { attributes: true });

document.body.className = 'foo';
document.body.className = 'bar';
document.body.className = 'baz';

console.log(observer.takeRecords());
console.log(observer.takeRecords());
Output:


We can use takeRecords() when you would like to call disconnect() but wish to handle all pending MutationRecord instances in the queue which are discarded by calling disconnect().
