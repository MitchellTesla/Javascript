XML namespaces allow elements from different XML-based languages to be mixed together in a single, well-formed document without fear of element name clashes.

Technically, XML namespaces are not supported by HTML but supported in XHTML; therefore, the examples in this section are in XHTML.

Namespaces are specified using the xmlns attribute.

The namespace for XHTML is http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml and should be included on the <html> element of any well-formed XHTML page, as shown in the following example:

Copy
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
 <head>
   <title>Example XHTML page</title>
 </head>
 <body>
   Hello world!
 </body>
</html>
For this example, all elements are considered to be part of the XHTML namespace by default.

You can explicitly create a prefix for an XML namespace using xmlns, followed by a colon, followed by the prefix, as in this example:

Copy
<xhtml:html xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <xhtml:head>
    <xhtml:title>Example XHTML page</xhtml:title>
  </xhtml:head>
  <xhtml:body>
    Hello world!
  </xhtml:body>
</xhtml:html>
Here, the namespace for XHTML is defined with a prefix of xhtml, requiring all XHTML elements to begin with that prefix.

Attributes may be qualified by namespace to avoid confusion between languages, as shown in the following example:

Copy
<xhtml:html xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <xhtml:head>
    <xhtml:title>Example XHTML page</xhtml:title>
  </xhtml:head>
  <xhtml:body xhtml:class="home">
    Hello world!
  </xhtml:body>
</xhtml:html>
The class attribute in this example is prefixed with xhtml.

Adding namespace isn't really necessary when only one XML-based language is being used in a document; it is, however, very useful when mixing two languages together.

Consider the following document containing both XHTML and SVG:

Copy
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <head>
    <title>Example XHTML page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1"
       viewBox="0 0 100 100" style="width:100%; height:100%">
      <rect x="0" y="0" width="100" height="100" style="fill:red" />
     </svg>
  </body>
</html>
In this example, the <svg> element is indicated as foreign to the containing document by setting its own namespace.

All children of the <svg> element, as well as all attributes of the elements, are considered to be in the http://www.w3.org/2000/svg namespace.

Even though the document is technically an XHTML document, the SVG code is considered valid because of the use of namespaces.
