The range can create a clone of itself and can be inserted else where in the document by using cloneContents().

For example, consider the following HTML:

Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <p id="p1"><b>Hello</b> world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
Copy
let p1 = document.getElementById("p1"),
    helloNode = p1.firstChild.firstChild,
    worldNode = p1.lastChild,
    range = document.createRange();

range.setStart(helloNode, 2);
range.setEnd(worldNode, 3);

let fragment = range.cloneContents();
p1.parentNode.appendChild(fragment);
cloneContents() method returns a document fragment.

The document fragment returned by cloneContents() contains clones of the nodes contained in the range instead of the actual nodes.

The splitting of nodes ensures that a well-formed document isn't produced until one of these methods is called.

The original HTML remains intact right up until the point that the DOM is modified.
