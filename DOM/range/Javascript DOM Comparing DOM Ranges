We can use the compareBoundaryPoints() method to determine if the ranges have any boundaries in common between two range objects.

The method accepts two arguments: the range to compare to and how to compare.

It is one of the following constant values:

Value
Number
Meaning
Range.START_TO_START
Range.START_TO_END
Range.END_TO_END
Range.END_TO_START
0
1
2
3
Compares the starting point of the first range to the starting point of the second.
Compares the starting point of the first range to the end point of the second.
Compares the end point of the first range to the end point of the second.
Compares the end point of the first range to the starting point of the second.
The compareBoundaryPoints() method returns

-1 if the point from the first range comes before the point from the second range,
0 if the points are equal, or
1 if the point from the first range comes after the point from the second range.
Consider the following example:

Copy
let range1 = document.createRange();
let range2 = document.createRange();
let p1 = document.getElementById("p1");

range1.selectNodeContents(p1);
range2.selectNodeContents(p1);
range2.setEndBefore(p1.lastChild);

console.log(range1.compareBoundaryPoints(Range.START_TO_START, range2));  
console.log(range1.compareBoundaryPoints(Range.END_TO_END, range2));
