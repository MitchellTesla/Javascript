A range can be used to select a section of a document regardless of node boundaries.

A DOM range can be created using createRange() from Document type, as shown here:

Copy
let range = document.createRange();
The newly created range is linked to the document on which it was created and cannot be used on other documents.

This range can then be used to select specific parts of the document behind the scenes.

Once a range has been created and its position set, a number of different operations can be performed on the range.

Each range is represented by an instance of the Range type, which has a number of properties and methods.

The following properties provide information about the range:

Property
Meaning
startContainer

The node within which the range starts.
The parent of the first node in the selection.
startOffset


The offset within the startContainer where the range starts.
If startContainer is a text node, comment node, or CData node, the startOffset is the number of characters skipped before the range starts;
otherwise, the offset is the index of the first child node in the range.
endContainer

The node within which the range ends.
The parent of the last node in the selection.
endOffset

The offset within the endContainer where the range ends.
It follows the same rules as startOffset.
commonAncestorContainer
The deepest node in the document that has both startContainer and endContainer as descendants.
These properties are filled when the range is placed into a specific position in the document.
