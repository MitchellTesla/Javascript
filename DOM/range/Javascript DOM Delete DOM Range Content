When a range is created, internally it creates a document fragment node where all of the nodes in the selection are attached.

The range contents must be well formed in order for this process to take place.

The range does not represent a well-formed DOM structure if the selection begins inside one text node and ends in another.

Ranges can recognize missing opening and closing tags and can reconstruct a valid DOM structure to operate on.

With the range created, the contents of the range can be manipulated using a variety of methods.

Delete
For example, consider the following HTML:

Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <p id="p1"><b>Hello</b> world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
The method deleteContents() simply deletes the contents of the range from the document.

Here is an example:

Copy
let p1 = document.getElementById("p1"),
    helloNode = p1.firstChild.firstChild,
    worldNode = p1.lastChild,
    range = document.createRange();

range.setStart(helloNode, 2);
range.setEnd(worldNode, 3);

range.deleteContents();
Executing this code results in the following HTML being shown on the page:

Copy
<p><b>He</b>rld!</p>
Because the range selection process altered the underlying DOM structure to remain well formed, the resulting DOM structure is well formed even after removing the contents.
