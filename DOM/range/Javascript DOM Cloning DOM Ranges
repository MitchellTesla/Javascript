Ranges can be cloned by calling the cloneRange() method.

For example, consider the following HTML:

Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <p id="p1"><b>Hello</b> world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
This method creates an exact duplicate of the range on which it is called:

Copy
let p1 = document.getElementById("p1"),
   helloNode = p1.firstChild.firstChild,
   worldNode = p1.lastChild,
   range = document.createRange();

range.setStart(helloNode, 2);
range.setEnd(worldNode, 3);

let newRange = range.cloneRange();
The new range contains all of the same properties as the original, and its end points can be modified without affecting the original in any way.
