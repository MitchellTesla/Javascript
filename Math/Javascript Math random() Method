The Math.random() method returns a random number between the 0 and the 1, not including either 0 or 1.

You can use Math.random() to select numbers within a certain integer range by using the following formula:

Copy
number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 
               total_number_of_choices + first_possible_value)
The Math.floor() method is used here because Math.random() always returns a decimal value, meaning that multiplying it by a number and adding another still yields a decimal value.

So, if you wanted to select a number between 1 and 10, the code would look like this:

Copy
let num = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
You see 10 possible values (1 through 10), with the first possible value being 1. If you want to select a number between 2 and 10, then the code would look like this:

Copy
let num = Math.floor(Math.random() * 9 + 2);
There are only nine numbers when counting from 2 to 10, so the total number of choices is nine, with the first possible value being 2.

The following code defines a function to select random value within a range.

Copy
function selectFrom(lowerValue, upperValue) {
  let choices = upperValue - lowerValue + 1;
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * choices + lowerValue);
}

let num = selectFrom(2,10);
console.log(num);  // number between 2 and 10, inclusive
Here, the function selectFrom() accepts two arguments: the lowest value that should be returned and the highest value that should be returned.

The number of choices is calculated by subtracting the two values and adding one and then applying the previous formula to those numbers.

So it's possible to select a number between 2 and 10 (inclusive) by calling selectFrom(2,10).

Random item
Using the function, it's easy to select a random item from an array, as shown here:

Copy
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "black", "purple", "brown"];
let color = colors[selectFrom(0, colors.length-1)];
console.log(color);
Output:


In this example, the second argument to selectFrom() is the length of the array minus 1, which is the last position in an array.
