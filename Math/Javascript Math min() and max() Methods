The Math object contains many methods aimed at performing both simple and complex mathematical calculations.

The min() and max() methods determine which number is the smallest or largest in a group of numbers.

These methods accept any number of parameters, as shown in the following example:

Copy
let max = Math.max(3, 5, 2, 1);
console.log(max);  // 5

let min = Math.min(3, 5, 32, 16);
console.log(min);  // 3
These methods are useful for avoiding extra loops and if statements to determine the maximum value out of a group of numbers.

To find the maximum or the minimum value in an array, you can use the spread operator as follows:

Copy
let values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
let max = Math.max(...values);
console.log(max);
Output:
8
