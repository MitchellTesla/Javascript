The document object, as an instance of HTMLDocument, has several additional properties that standard Document objects do not have.

title
The property title contains the text in the <title> element and is displayed in the title bar or tab of the browser window.

This property can be used to retrieve the current page title and to change the page title such that the changes are reflected in the browser title bar.

Changing the value of the title property does not change the <title> element.

Here is an example: get the document title

Copy
let originalTitle = document.title;
set the document title.

Copy
document.title = "New page title";
URL, domain, referrer
The URL property contains the complete URL of the page.

The domain property contains the domain name of the page.

The referrer property gives the URL of the page that linked to this page.

The referrer property may be an empty string if there is no referrer to the page.

get the complete URL

Copy
let url = document.URL;
get the domain.

Copy
let domain = document.domain;
get the referrer.

Copy
let referrer = document.referrer;
The URL and domain properties are related.

For example, if document.URL is https://www.demo2s.com/css/, then document.domain will be www.demo2s.com.

Only the domain property is the only one that can be set.

If the URL contains a sub domain, such as abc.demo2s.com, or www.demo2s.com, the domain may be set only to "demo2s.com".

The property can never be set to a domain that the URL doesn't contain, as this example demonstrates:

Copy
// page from abc.demo2s.com
document.domain = "demo2s.com";   // succeeds
document.domain = "example.com";  // error!
Setting document.domain is useful when there is a frame or iframe on the page from a different sub domain.

Pages from different sub domains can't communicate with one another via JavaScript because of cross-domain security restrictions.

By setting document.domain in each page to the same value, the pages can access JavaScript objects from each other.

You cannot set document.domain to "demo2s.com" and then try to set it back to "abc.demo2s.com" because the latter would cause an error, as shown here:

Copy
// page from abc.demo2s.com
document.domain = "demo2s.com";      // loosen - succeeds
document.domain = "abc.demo2s.com";  // tighten - error!
