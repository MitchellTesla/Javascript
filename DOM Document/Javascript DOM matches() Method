matches() method accepts a single argument, a CSS selector, and returns true if the given element matches the selector or false if not.

For example:

Copy
if (document.body.matches ("body.page1")){
  // true
}

This method checks if an element would be returned by querySelector() or querySelectorAll() when you already have the element reference.

Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera fully support it.
