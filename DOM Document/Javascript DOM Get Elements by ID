Via DOM we can retrieve references to a specific element or sets of elements to perform certain operations.

The Document type provides two methods to this end: getElementById() and getElementsByTagName().

By ID
The getElementById() method accepts a single argument-the ID of an element to retrieve-and returns the element if found, or null if an element with that ID doesn't exist.

The ID must be an exact match, including character case, to the id attribute of an element on the page.

Consider the following element:

Copy
<div id="myDiv">Some text</div>
This element can be retrieved using the following code:

Copy
// retrieve reference to the <div>
let div = document.getElementById("myDiv");
The following code, however, would return null:

Copy
let div = document.getElementById("mydiv");  // null
If more than one element with the same ID are in a page, getElementById() returns the element that appears first in the document.
