The cookie property allows you to read, add to, and update the cookies associated with the document.

Reading and Creating Cookies.

Copy
function readCookies() {
    document.getElementById("cookiedata").innerHTML = document.cookie;
}

function createCookie() {
    cookieCount++;
    document.cookie = "Cookie_" + cookieCount + "=Value_" + cookieCount;
    readCookies();
}

function updateCookie() {
    document.cookie = "Cookie_" + cookieCount + "=Updated_" + cookieCount;
    readCookies();
}

The cookie property works in a slightly odd way.

When you read the value of the property, you get back all of the cookies that are associated with the document.Cookies are name/value pairs in the form name=value.

If multiple cookies are available, all are returned as the result of the cookie property, separated by a semicolon, for example: name1=value1;name2=value2.

By contrast, when you want to create a new cookie, you assign a new name/value pair as the value of the cookie property, and it is added to the set of cookies for the document.

You can set only one cookie at a time.

If you set a value whose name portion corresponds to an existing cookie, then the value portion is used to update the cookie.

To demonstrate this, the code above contains a script that reads, creates, and updates cookies.

The readCookies() function reads the value of the document.cookie property and sets the result as the content of a paragraph (p) element.

There are two button elements in the document.

When the Add Cookie button is clicked, the createCookie() function assigns a new value to the cookie property, which will be added to the cookie collection.

The Update Cookie button causes the updateCookie() function to be invoked.

This function provides a new value for an existing cookie.

Although the name=value form is the default for adding cookies, you can apply some additional data that changes the way the cookie is handled.

These additions are described in the following table.

The Additional Fields That Can Be Added to a Cookie.

Addition
Description
path=<path>
Sets the path associated with the cookie; this default to the path of the current document if not specified.
domain=<domain>
Sets the domain associated with the cookie; this defaults to the domain of the current document if not specified.
max-age=<seconds>
Sets the life of the cookie in terms of the number of seconds from the moment it was created.
expires=<date>
Sets the life of the cookie using a GMT-format date.
secure
The cookie will be sent only over a secure (HTTPS) connection.
Each of these additional items is prepended to the name/value pair and separated with a semicolon, like this:

Copy
document.cookie = "MyCookie=MyValue;max-age=10";
