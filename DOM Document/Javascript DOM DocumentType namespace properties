The DocumentType type adds three new properties: publicId, systemId, and internalSubset.

The publicId and systemId properties represent data that is readily available in a doctype but were inaccessible using DOM Level 1.

Consider the following HTML doctype:

Copy
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-// W3C// DTD HTML 4.01// EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
In this doctype, the publicId is "-// W3C// DTD HTML 4.01// EN" and the systemId is http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd.

Browsers that support DOM Level 2 should be able to run the following JavaScript code:

Copy
console.log(document.doctype.publicId);
console.log(document.doctype.systemId);
The internalSubset property accesses any additional definitions that are included in the doctype, as shown in the following example:

Copy
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-// W3C// DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict// EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"

[<!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)>] >
For this code, document.doctype.internalSubset returns "<!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)>".

Internal subsets are rarely used in HTML and are slightly more common in XML.
