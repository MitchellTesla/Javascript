The browser can render a document in either standards or quirks mode, we can determine in which mode the browser was rendering the page.

The property on the document named compatMode can indicate what rendering mode the browser is in.

The compatMode property tells you how the browser has handled the content in the document.

The compatMode property will return one of two values, as described in the following table.

Value
Description
CSS1Compat
The document conforms to a valid HTML specification.
BackCompat
The document contains nonstandard features and has triggered the quirks mode.
The following example shows how to use the compatMode.

When in standards mode, document.compatMode is equal to CSS1Compat; when in quirks mode, document.compatMode is BackCompat:

Copy
if (document.compatMode == "CSS1Compat"){
  console.log("Standards mode");
} else {
  console.log("Quirks mode");
}
The compatMode property was added to HTML5 to formalize its implementation.
