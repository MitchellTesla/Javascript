JavaScript represents document nodes via the Document type.

In browsers, the document object is an instance of HTMLDocument which inherits from Document and represents the entire HTML page.

The document object is a property of window and so is accessible globally.

A Document node has the following characteristics:

Item	Value
nodeType	9
nodeName	"#document"
nodeValue	null
parentNode	null
ownerDocument	null
childNodes	one Document Type, one Element, ProcessingInstruction, or Comment.
The document object can be used to get information about the page and to manipulate both its appearance and the underlying structure.
