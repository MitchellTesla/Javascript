The Document importNode() takes a node from a different document and import it into a new document so that it can be added into the document structure.

Every node has an ownerDocument property that indicates the document it belongs to.

If a method such as appendChild() is called and a node with a different ownerDocument is passed in, an error will occur.

Calling importNode() on a node from a different document returns a new version of the node that is owned by the current document.

The importNode() method accepts two arguments: the node to clone and a Boolean value indicating if the child nodes should also be copied.

The result is a duplicate of the node that is suitable for use in the document.

Here is an example:

Copy
// import node and all children
let newNode = document.importNode(oldNode, true);   
document.body.appendChild(newNode);
This method is used more frequently with XML documents.
