You can get a Window object in two ways.

The official HTML5 way is to use the defaultView property on the Document object.

Another approach is to use the window global variable, which all of the browsers support.

The following code demonstrates both techniques.

Obtaining a Window Object.

Copy
document.getElementById("owidth").innerHTML = window.outerWidth;
document.getElementById("oheight").innerHTML
    = document.defaultView.outerHeight;

In the script we use the Window object to read the value of a pair of properties, outerWidth and outerHeight.

Getting Information about the Window
The basic functionality of the Window object relates to the window in which the document is currently displayed.

The following table lists the properties and methods that handle this functionality.

For the purposes of HTML, tabs within a browser window are treated as windows in their own right.

Name
Description
Returns
innerHeight
Gets the height of the window content area
number
innerWidth
Gets the width of the window content area
number
outerHeight

Gets the height of the window, including borders, menu bars, and
so on
number

outerWidth

Gets the width of the window, including borders, menu bars, and
so on
number

pageXOffset

Gets the number of pixels that the window has been scrolled
horizontally from the top-left corner
number

pageYOffset

Gets the number of pixels that the window has been scrolled
vertically from the top-left corner
number

screen
Returns a Screen object describing the screen
Screen
screenLeft
screenX
Gets the number of pixels from the left edge of the window to the
left edge of the screen
number

screenTop
screenY
Gets the number of pixels from the top edge of the window to the
top edge of the screen
number

The following code shows how to use these properties to get information about the window.

Copy
document.getElementById("ow").innerHTML = window.outerWidth;
document.getElementById("oh").innerHTML = window.outerHeight;
document.getElementById("iw").innerHTML = window.innerHeight;
document.getElementById("ih").innerHTML = window.innerHeight;
document.getElementById("sw").innerHTML = window.screen.width;
document.getElementById("sh").innerHTML = window.screen.height;

The script in this example displays the value of various Window properties in a table.

Notice that we used the screen property to obtain a Screen object.

This object provides information about the screen that the window is displayed on and defines the properties shown in the following table.
