The document object can write to the output stream of a web page via four methods:

Copy
write(), 
writeln(), 
open(), and
close().
The write() and writeln() methods each accept a string argument to write to the output stream.

write() simply adds the text as is.

writeln() appends a new-line character (\n) to the end of the string.

These two methods can be used as a page is being loaded to dynamically add content to the page, as shown in the following example:

Copy
document.write("<strong>" + (new Date()).toString() + "</strong>");

This example outputs the current date and time as the page is being loaded.

The date is enclosed by a <strong> element, which is treated the same as if it were included in the HTML portion of the page, meaning that a DOM element is created and can later be accessed.

Any HTML that is output via write() or writeln() is treated this way.

The write() and writeln() methods are often used to dynamically include external resources such as JavaScript files.

Copy
<html>
<head>
  <title>document.write() Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    document.write("<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"file.js\">" +
      "<\/script>");
  </script>
</body>
</html>
The string "<\/script>" no longer registers as a closing tag for the outermost <script> tag, so there is no extra content output to the page.

If document.write() is called after the page has been completely loaded, the content overwrites the entire page, as shown in the following example:

Copy
window.onload = function(){
        document.write("Hello world!");
};

In this example, the window.onload event handler is used to delay the execution of the function until the page is completely loaded.

When that happens, the string "Hello world!" overwrites the entire page content.

The open() and close() methods are used to open and close the web page output stream, respectively.

Neither method is required to be used when write() or writeln() is used during the course of page loading.

Note
Document writing is not supported in strict XHTML documents.

For pages that are served with the application/xml+xhtml content type, these methods will not work.
