The getElementsByTagName() accepts a single argument-the tag name of the elements to retrieve-and returns a NodeList containing zero or more elements.

In HTML documents, this method returns an HTMLCollection object, which is very similar to a NodeList in that it is considered a live collection.

For example, the following code retrieves all <img> elements in the page and returns an HTMLCollection:

Copy
let images = document.getElementsByTagName("img");
This code stores an HTMLCollection object in the images variable.

As with NodeList objects, items in HTMLCollection objects can be accessed using bracket notation or the item() method.

The number of elements in the object can be retrieved via the length property, as this example demonstrates:

output the number of images

Copy
console.log(images.length);
output the src attribute of the first image

Copy
console.log(images[0].src);
output the src attribute of the first image

Copy
console.log(images.item(0).src);
The HTMLCollection object has an additional method, namedItem(), that lets you reference an item in the collection via its name attribute.

For example, suppose you had the following <img> element in a page:

Copy
<img src="myimage.gif" name="myImage">
A reference to this <img> element can be retrieved from the images variable like this:

Copy
let myImage = images.namedItem("myImage");
In this way, an HTMLCollection gives you access to named items in addition to indexed items, making it easier to get exactly the elements.

You can also access named items by using bracket notation, as shown in the following example:

Copy
let myImage = images["myImage"];
For HTMLCollection objects, bracket notation can be used with either numeric or string indices.

Behind the scenes, a numeric index calls item() and a string index calls namedItem().

Get All
To retrieve all elements in the document, pass in * to getElementsByTagName().

The asterisk is generally understood to mean "all" in JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

Here's an example:

Copy
let allElements = document.getElementsByTagName("*");
This single line of code returns an HTMLCollection containing all of the elements in the order in which they appear.

So the first item is the <html> element, the second is the <head> element, and so on.

getElementsByTagName() method is case-insensitive for maximum compatibility with existing HTML pages.

When used in XML pages, including XHTML, getElementsByTagName() switches to case-sensitive mode.
