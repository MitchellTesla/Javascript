The DOM specification states that the children of a Document node can be a DocumentType, Element, ProcessingInstruction, or Comment, there are two built-in shortcuts to child nodes.

The first is the documentElement property, which always points to the <html> element in an HTML page.

The document element is always represented in the childNodes list as well, but the documentElement property gives direct access to that element.

Consider the following simple page:

Copy
<html>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
When this page is parsed by a browser, the document has only one child node, which is the <html> element.

This element is accessible from both documentElement and the childNodes list, as shown here:

Copy
let html = document.documentElement;     // get reference to <html>
console.log(html === document.childNodes[0]);  // true
console.log(html === document.firstChild);     // true
This example shows that the values of documentElement, firstChild, and childNodes[0] are pointing to the <html> element.

As an instance of HTMLDocument, the document object also has a body property that points to the <body> element directly.

document.body can be used in JavaScript, as this example shows:

Copy
let body = document.body;  // get reference to <body>
Both document.documentElement and document.body are supported in all major browsers.

Another possible child node of a Document is a DocumentType.

The <!DOCTYPE> tag is considered to be a separate entity from other parts of the document, and its information is accessible through the doctype property, which is document.doctype in browsers, as shown here:

Copy
let doctype = document.doctype;   // get reference to <!DOCTYPE>
Comments that appear outside of the <html> element are child nodes of the document.

Consider the following HTML page:

Copy
<!-- first comment -->
<html>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
<!-- second comment -->
This page seems to have three child nodes: a comment, the <html> element, and another comment.

Logically, you would expect document.childNodes to have three items corresponding to what appears in the code.

In practice, however, browsers handle comments outside of the <html> element in different ways with respect to ignoring one or both of the comment nodes.
