A DocumentType object contains all of the information about the document's doctype and has the following characteristics:

Item
Value
nodeType
10
nodeName
the name of the doctype.
nodeValue
null
parentNode
a Document.
Child nodes
not supported.
DocumentType objects cannot be created dynamically in DOM Level 1; they are created only as the document's code is being parsed.

For browsers that support it, the DocumentType object is stored in document.doctype.

DOM Level 1 describes three properties for DocumentType objects:

Property
Meaning
name
entities
notations
the name of the doctype
a NamedNodeMap of entities described by the doctype;
a NamedNodeMap of notations described by the doctype.
Because documents in browsers typically use an HTML or XHTML doctype, the entities and notations lists are typically empty.

They are filled only with inline doc types.

This property is filled with the name of the doctype, which is the text that appears immediately after <!DOCTYPE.

Consider the following HTML 4.01 strict doctype:

Copy
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-// W3C// DTD HTML 4.01// EN"
"http:// www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
For this doctype, the name property is "HTML":

Copy
console.log(document.doctype.name); // "HTML"
