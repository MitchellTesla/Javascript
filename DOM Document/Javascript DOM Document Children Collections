The document object has several special collections.

Each of these collections is an HTMLCollection object and provides faster access to common parts of the document, as described here:

Name
Description
document.anchors
Contains all <a> elements with a name attribute in the document.
document.applets

Contains all <applet> elements in the document.
This collection is deprecated because the <applet> element is no longer recommended for use.
document.forms

Contains all <form> elements in the document.
The same as document.getElementsByTagName("form").
document.images

Contains all <img> elements in the document.
The same as document.getElementsByTagName("img").
document.links
Contains all <a> elements with an href attribute in the document.
These special collections are always available on HTMLDocument objects and, like all HTMLCollection objects, are constantly updated to match the contents of the current document.
