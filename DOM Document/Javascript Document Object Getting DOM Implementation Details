The document.implementation property provides you with information about the browser implementation of the DOM features.

This property returns a DOMImplementation object, which has one method that you are interested in: the hasFeature method.

You can use this method to determine which DOM features are implemented.

Using the document.implementation.hasFeature() Method.

Copy
let features = ["Core", "HTML", "CSS", "Selectors-API"];
let levels = ["1.0", "2.0", "3.0"];

document.writeln("<pre>");
for (let i = 0; i < features.length; i++) {
    document.writeln("Checking for feature: " + features[i]);
    for (let j = 0; j < levels.length; j++) {
        document.write(features[i] + " Level " + levels[j] + ": ");
        document.writeln(document.implementation.hasFeature(features[i],
            levels[j]));
    }
}
document.write("</pre>")

This script checks some of the different DOM features and the defined feature levels.

This isn't as useful as it might appear.

First, browsers don't always report the features they implement correctly.

Some implement features but don't report them through the hasFeature() method, and others claim to implement features but don't.

Second, a browser reporting that a feature doesn't mean that it is implemented in a useful way.
