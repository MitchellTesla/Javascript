The characterSet property indicates the actual character set being used by the document and can also be used to specify a new character set.

By default, this value is "UTF-16".

Its value may be changed by using <meta> elements or response headers or through setting the characterSet property directly.

Here's an example:

Copy
console.log(document.characterSet);   // "UTF-16"
document.characterSet = "UTF-8";
