A reference value, or object, is an instance of a specific reference type.

In ECMAScript, reference types are structures used to group data and functionality together.

They should not be called classes.

ECMAScript lacks some basic constructs that have traditionally been associated with object-oriented programming, including classes and interfaces.

Reference types are sometimes called object definitions because they describe the properties and methods that objects should have.

Even though reference types are similar to classes, the two concepts are not equivalent.

ECMAScript objects are considered to be instances of a particular reference type.

New objects are created by using the new operator followed by a constructor.

A constructor is simply a function whose purpose is to create a new object.

Consider the following line of code:

Copy
let now = new Date();
This code creates a new instance of the Date reference type and stores it in the variable now.

The constructor being used is Date(), which creates a simple object with only the default properties and methods.

ECMAScript provides a number of native reference types, such as Date, to help developers with common computing tasks.
