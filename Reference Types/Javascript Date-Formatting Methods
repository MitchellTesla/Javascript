There are several Date type methods used specifically to format the date as a string.

They are as follows:

Method
Description
toDateString()
toTimeString()
toLocaleDateString()
toLocaleTimeString()
toUTCString()
Displays the date's day of the week, month, day of the month, and year in an implementation-specific format.
Displays the date's hours, minutes, seconds, and time zone in an implementation-specific format.
Displays the date's day of the week, month, day of the month, and year in an implementation and locale-specific format.
Displays the date's hours, minutes, and seconds in an implementation-specific format.
Displays the complete UTC date in an implementation-specific format.
The output of these methods varies widely from browser to browser and therefore can't be employed in a user interface for consistent display of a date.

There is a method called toGMTString(), which is equivalent to toUTCString() and is provided for backwards compatibility.

Copy
const d = new Date();

console.log(d.toDateString());
console.log(d.toTimeString());
console.log(d.toLocaleDateString());
console.log(d.toLocaleTimeString());
console.log(d.toUTCString());
Output:
