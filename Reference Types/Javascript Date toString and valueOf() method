The Date type overrides toLocaleString(), toString(), and valueOf().

The Date type's toLocaleString() method returns the date and time in a format appropriate for the locale in which the browser is being run.

This often means that the format includes AM or PM for the time and doesn't include any time-zone information.

The toString() method typically returns the date and time with time-zone information, and the time is typically indicated in 24-hour notation (hours ranging from 0 to 23).

The valueOf() method for the Date type returns the milliseconds representation of the date so that operators (such as less-than and greater than) will work appropriately for date values.

Consider this example:

Copy
let date1 = new Date(2019, 0, 1);    // "January 1, 2019"
let date2 = new Date(2019, 1, 1);    // "February 1, 2019"

console.log(date1 < date2);  // true
console.log(date1 > date2);  // false
The date January 1, 2019, comes before February 1, 2019, so it would make sense to say that the former is less than the latter.

Because the milliseconds representation of January 1, 2019, is less than that of February 1, 2019, the less-than operator returns true when the dates are compared, providing an easy way to determine the order of dates.
