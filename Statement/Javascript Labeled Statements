It is possible to label statements for later use with the following syntax:

Copy
label: statement
Here's an example:

Copy
start: for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
     console.log(i);
}
In this example, the label start can be referenced later by using the break or continue statement.

Labeled statements are typically used with nested loops.
