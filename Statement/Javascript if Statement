The Javascript if statement has the following syntax:

Copy
if (condition)
   statement1
else
   statement2
The condition can be any expression; it doesn't even have to evaluate to an actual Boolean value.

ECMAScript automatically converts the result of the expression into a Boolean by calling the Boolean() casting function on it.

If the condition evaluates to true, statement1 is executed; if the condition evaluates to false, statement2 is executed.

Each of the statements can be either a single line or a code block.

Consider this example:

Copy
if (i > 25)
  console.log("Greater than 25.");  // one-line statement
else {
  console.log("Less than or equal to 25.");  // block statement
}
It's the best coding practice to always use block statements, even if only one line of code is to be executed.

You can also chain if statements together like so:

Copy
if (condition1)
     statement1
else if (condition2)
     statement2
else
    statement3
Here's an example:

Copy
if (i > 25) {
 console.log("Greater than 25.");
} else if (i < 0) {
 console.log("Less than 0.");
} else {
 console.log("Between 0 and 25, inclusive.");
}
