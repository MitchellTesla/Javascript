The do-while statement is a post-test loop, meaning that the escape condition is evaluated only after the code inside the loop has been executed.

The body of the loop is always executed at least once before the expression is evaluated.

Here's the syntax:

Copy
do {
  statement
} while (expression);
And here's an example of its usage:

Copy
let i = 0;
do {
   i += 2;
} while (i < 10);
In this example, the loop continues as long as i is less than 10.

The variable starts at 0 and is incremented by two each time through the loop.
