The while statement is a pretest loop. The escape condition is evaluated before the code inside the loop has been executed.

It is possible that the body of the loop is never executed.

Here's the syntax:

Copy
while(expression)
   statement
And here's an example of its usage:

Copy
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
   i += 2;
}
In this example, the variable i starts out equal to 0 and is incremented by two each time through the loop.

As long as the variable is less than 10, the loop will continue.
