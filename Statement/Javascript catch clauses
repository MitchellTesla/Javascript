Sometime we use a catch clause to detect and stop the propagation of an exception, and we do not care about the type or the value of the exception.

In ES2019 and later, you can omit the parentheses and the identifier and use the catch keyword bare in this case.

Here is an example:

Copy
// Like JSON.parse(), but return undefined instead of throwing an error
function parseJSON(s) {
    try {
        return JSON.parse(s);
    } catch {
        // Something went wrong but we don't care what it was
        return undefined;
    }
}
