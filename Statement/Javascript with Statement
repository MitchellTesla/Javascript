The with statement sets the scope of the code within a particular object.

The syntax is as follows:

Copy
with (expression) statement;
The with statement was created as a convenience for times when a single object was being coded to over and over again, as in this example:

Copy
let qs = location.search.substring(1);
let hostName = location.hostname;
let url = location.href;
Here, the location object is used on every line. This code can be rewritten using the with statement as follows:

Copy
with(location) {
  let qs = search.substring(1);
  let hostName = hostname;
  let url = href;
}
In this rewritten version of the code, the with statement is used in conjunction with the location object.

This means that each variable inside the statement is first considered to be a local variable.

If it's not found to be a local variable, the location object is searched to see if it has a property of the same name.

If so, then the variable is evaluated as a property of location.

In strict mode, the with statement is not allowed and is considered a syntax error.
