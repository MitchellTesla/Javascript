Promise.reject() instantiates a rejected promise and throws an asynchronous error.

The asynchronous error will not be caught by try/catch and can only be caught by a rejection handler.

The following two promise instantiations are effectively equivalent:

Copy
let p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject());
let p2 = Promise.reject();
The 'reason' field of this resolved promise will be the first argument passed to Promise.reject().

This will also be the error passed to the reject handler:

Copy
let p = Promise.reject(3);
setTimeout(console.log, 0, p);  // Promise <rejected>: 3

p.then(null, (e) => setTimeout(console.log, 0, e));  // 3
