ECMAScript variables are loosely typed. A variable can hold any type of data.

Every variable is a named placeholder for a value.

There are three keywords that can be used to declare a variable:

var
const
let
var is supported for all versions and let and const were introduced in ECMAScript 6.

Copy
var a = 'a';
console.log(a);

let b = 'b';
console.log(b);

const c = 'c'
console.log(c);
Output:


Note
The introduction of let and const in ECMAScript 6 bring better tooling to the Javascript language.

It increases precision of declaration scope and semantics.

Don't Use var
With let and const, we no longer need to use var in our code base.

Prefer const Over let
Using const declarations allows the browser runtime to enforce constant variables.

We should declare variables as const unless they know they will need to reassign its value at some point.
