let declarations cannot be used in a way that assumes hoisting:

Copy
// name is hoisted, since it is defined by var
console.log(name);  // undefined
var name = 'Javascript';

// age is not hoisted, since it is defined by let
console.log(age);  // ReferenceError: age is not defined
let age = 26;
JavaScript engines knows that the let declarations that appear later in a block.

These variables cannot be referenced before the actual declaration occurs.

Any attempted references to these variables from the segment of execution that occurs before the declaration will throw a ReferenceError.
