When declaring variables using let in the global context, variables will not attach to the window object as they do with var.

Copy
var name = 'Javascript';
console.log(window.name);  // 'Javascript'

let age = 26;
console.log(window.age);   // undefined
However, let declarations will still occur inside the global block scope, which will persist for the lifetime of the page.

Copy
let age = 26;

function test(){
   console.log(age);
}
test();
Output:


You must ensure your page does not attempt duplicate declarations in order to avoid throwing a SyntaxError.
