The DOM textInput event fires when a character is input to an editable area.

The keypress fires on any element that can have focus but textInput fires only on editable areas.

The textInput fires only for keys that result in a new character being inserted, whereas keypress fires for keys that affect text in any way including Backspace.

The textInput event provides a data property on the event object that contains the character that was inserted.

The value of data is always the exact character that was inserted, so if the S key is pressed without Shift, data is "s", but if the same key is pressed holding Shift down, then data is "S".

The textInput event can be used as follows:

Copy
let textbox = document.getElementById("myText");
textbox.addEventListener("textInput", (event) => {
    console.log(event.data);
});
In this example, the character that was inserted into the text box is displayed in a log message.
