The devicemotion event can inform you when the device is actually moving, not just when it has changed orientation.

For instance, devicemotion is useful to determine that the device is falling or is being held by someone who is walking.

When the devicemotion event fires, the event object contains the following additional properties:

Property
Meaning
acceleration
An object containing x, y, and z properties that tells you the acceleration in each dimension without considering gravity.
accelerationIncludingGravity
An object containing x, y, and z properties that tells you the acceleration in each dimension, including the natural acceleration of gravity in the z-axis.
interval
The amount of time, in milliseconds, that will pass before another devicemotion event is fired. This value should be constant from event to event.
rotationRate
An object containing the alpha, beta, and gamma properties that indicate device orientation.
If acceleration, accelerationIncludingGravity, or rotationRate cannot be provided, then the property value is null.

Because of that, you should always check that the value is not null before using any of these properties.

For example:

Copy
window.addEventListener("devicemotion", (event) => {
  let output = document.getElementById("output");
  if (event.rotationRate !== null) {
    output.innerHTML += `Alpha=${event.rotationRate.alpha}` +
                        `Beta=${event.rotationRate.beta}` +
                        `Gamma=${event.rotationRate.gamma}`;
  }
});
