HTML5 introduced the hashchange event to notify developers when the URL hash changed.

The URL hash value is everything following a pound sign (#) in a URL.

The developers used the URL hash to store state information or navigational information in Ajax applications.

The onhashchange event handler must be attached to the window, and it is called whenever the URL hash changes.

The event object should have two additional properties: oldURL and newURL.

These properties hold the complete URL including the hash before the change and after the change.

The contrasting URLs are tracked in the following example:

Copy
window.addEventListener("hashchange", (event) => {
    console.log(`Old URL: ${event.oldURL}, New URL: ${event.newURL}`);
});
It's best to use the location object to determine the current hash:

Copy
window.addEventListener("hashchange", (event) => {
  console.log(`Current hash: ${location.hash}`);
});
