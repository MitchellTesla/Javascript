The orientationchange event can determine when the user switched the device from landscape to portrait mode.

The window.orientation property on mobile contains one of three values:

0 for portrait mode,
90 for landscape mode when rotated to the left (the Home button on the right), and
-90 for landscape mode when rotated to the right (the Home button on the left).
Whenever the user changes from one mode to another, the orientationchange event fires.

Typical usage of this event is as follows:

Copy
window.addEventListener("load", (event) => {
   let div = document.getElementById("myDiv");
   div.innerHTML = "Current orientation is " + window.orientation;

   window.addEventListener("orientationchange", (event) => {) {
      div.innerHTML = "Current orientation is " + window.orientation;
   });
});
In this example, the initial orientation is displayed when the load event fires.

Then, the event handler for orientationchange is assigned.

Whenever the event fires, the message on the page is updated to indicate the new orientation.

All iOS devices support both the orientationchange event and the window.orientation property.

Because orientationchange is considered a window event, you can also assign an event handler by adding the onorientationchange attribute to the <body> element.
