Focus events are fired when elements of a page receive or lose focus.

These events work in concert with the document.hasFocus() and document.activeElement properties to give insight as to how the user is navigating the page.

There are six focus events:

Event
Meaning
blur

Fires when an element has lost focus.
This event does not bubble and is supported in all browsers.
focus

Fires when an element has received focus.
This event does not bubble and is supported in all browsers.
focusin

Fires when an element has received focus.
This is a bubbling version of the focus HTML event.
focusout

Fires when an element has lost focus.
This is a generic version of the blur HTML event.
The two primary events of this group are focus and blur, both of which have been supported in browsers since the early days of JavaScript.

The focus events don't bubble.

This led to the inclusion of focusin and focusout.

When focus is moved from one element to another on the page, the order of events is as follows:

focusout fires on the element losing focus.
focusin fires on the element receiving focus.
blur fires on the element losing focus.
focus fires on the element receiving focus.
