There are many categories of events that can occur in a web browser.

The type of event being fired determines the information that is available about the event.

DOM Level 3 Events specifies the following event groups:

User interface (UI) events are general browser events that may have some interaction with the BOM.
Focus events are fired when an element gains or loses focus.
Mouse events are fired when the mouse is used to perform an action on the page.
Wheel events are fired when a mouse wheel (or similar device) is used.
Text events are fired when text is input into the document.
Keyboard events are fired when the keyboard is used to perform an action on the page.
Composition events are fired when inputting characters for an Input Method Editor IME.
In addition to these categories, HTML5 defines another set of events, and browsers often implement proprietary events both on the DOM and on the BOM.

These proprietary events are implemented differently across browsers.

All major browsers support DOM Level 2 and 3 Events.
