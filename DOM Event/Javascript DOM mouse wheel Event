The mousewheel event fires when the user interacts with the mouse wheel, rolling it vertically in either direction.

This event fires on each element and bubbles up to window on modern browsers.

The event object for the mousewheel event contains all standard information about mouse events and an additional property called wheelDelta.

When the mouse wheel is rolled toward the front of the mouse, wheelDelta is a positive multiple of 120; when the mouse wheel is rolled toward the rear of the mouse, wheelDelta is a negative multiple of 120.

An onmousewheel event handler can be assigned to any element on the page or to the document to handle all mouse wheel interactions.

Here's an example:

Copy
document.addEventListener("mousewheel", (event) => {
    console.log(event.wheelDelta);
});
This example simply displays the wheelDelta value when the event is fired.

In most cases, you need only know which direction the mouse wheel was turned, which can easily be determined by the sign of the wheelDelta value.

The mousewheel event was added to HTML5 and availabile in most browsers.
