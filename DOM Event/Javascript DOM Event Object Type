The type property is useful when you want to assign a single function to handle multiple events.

Here is an example which uses event.type:

Copy
let btn = document.getElementById("myBtn");
let handler = function(event) {
  switch(event.type) {
    case "click":
      console.log("Clicked");
      break;
    case "mouseover":
      event.target.style.backgroundColor = "red";
      break;
    case "mouseout":
      event.target.style.backgroundColor = "";
      break;
  }
};

btn.onclick = handler;
btn.onmouseover = handler;
btn.onmouseout = handler;
In this example, a single function called handler is defined to handle three different events: click, mouseover, and mouseout.

Using the event.type property, the function is able to determine which event occurred and then react appropriately.
