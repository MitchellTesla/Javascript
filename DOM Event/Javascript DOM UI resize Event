When the browser window is resized to a new height or width, the resize event fires.

This event fires on window, so an event handler can be assigned either via JavaScript or by using the onresize attribute on the <body> element.

Prefer to use the JavaScript approach, as shown here:

Copy
window.addEventListener("resize", (event) => {
   console.log("Resized");
});
The event object is created and its target is document in DOM-compliant browsers.

We should avoid computation-heavy code in the event handler for this event because it will be executed frequently and cause a noticeable slowdown in the browser.

NOTE The resize event also fires when the browser window is minimized or maximized.
