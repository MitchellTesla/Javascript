Even though the scroll event occurs on the window, it actually refers to changes in the appropriate page-level element.

In quirks mode, the changes are observable using the scrollLeft and scrollTop of the <body> element; in standards mode, the changes occur on the <html> element in all browsers except Safari, which still tracks scroll position on <body>.

The following example shows how to properly handle this:

Copy
window.addEventListener("scroll", (event) => {
  if (document.compatMode == "CSS1Compat") {
    console.log(document.documentElement.scrollTop);
  } else {
    console.log(document.body.scrollTop);
  }
});
This code assigns an event handler that outputs the vertical scroll position of the page, depending on the rendering mode.

The scroll event occurs repeatedly as the document is being scrolled, so it's best to keep the event handlers as simple as possible
