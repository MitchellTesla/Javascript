The deviceorientation event is fired on window when accelerometer information is available and changes.

The deviceorientation inform you of how the device is oriented in space.

A device is said to exist in three-dimensional space along an x-axis, a y-axis, and a z-axis.

These all start at zero when the device is at rest on a horizontal surface.x

The x-axis goes from the left of the device to the right, the y-axis goes from the bottom of the device to the top, and the z-axis goes from the back of the device to the front.

When deviceorientation fires, it returns information about how the values of each axis have changed relative to the device at rest.

The event object has five properties:

Property
Meaning
alpha
The difference in y-axis degrees as you rotate around the z-axis (side-to-side tilt); a floating point number between 0 and 360.
beta
The difference in z-axis degrees as you rotate around the x-axis (front-to-back tilt); a floating point number between -180 and 180.
gamma
The difference in the z-axis degrees as you rotate around the y-axis (twisting tilt); a floating point number between -90 and 90.
absolute
A Boolean value indicating if the device is returning absolute values or not.
compassCalibrated
A Boolean value indicating if the device's compass is properly calibrated or not.
Here's a simple example that outputs the values for alpha, beta, and gamma:

Copy
window.addEventListener("deviceorientation", (event) => {
   let output = document.getElementById("output");
   output.innerHTML =
      `Alpha=${event.alpha}, Beta=${event.beta], Gamma=${event.gamma$}<br>`;
});
You can use this information to rearrange or otherwise alter elements on the screen in reaction to the device changing its orientation.

For example, this code rotates an element in reaction to the device orientation:

Copy
window.addEventListener("deviceorientation", (event) => {
   let arrow = document.getElementById("arrow");
   arrow.style.webkitTransform = `rotate(${Math.round(event.alpha)}deg)`;
});
The element "arrow" is rotated along with the value of event.alpha, giving it a compass-like feel.
