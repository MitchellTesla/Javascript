The stopPropagation() method stops the flow of an event through the DOM structure immediately, canceling any further event capturing or bubbling before it occurs.

For example, an event handler added directly to a button can call stopPropagation() to prevent an event handler on document.body from being fired, as shown in the following example:

Copy
let btn = document.getElementById("myBtn");
btn.onclick = function(event) {
  console.log("Clicked");
  event.stopPropagation();
};

document.body.onclick = function(event) {
   console.log("Body clicked");
};
Without the call to stopPropagation() in this example, two messages would be logged when the button is clicked.

However, the click event never reaches document.body, so the onclick event handler is never executed.
