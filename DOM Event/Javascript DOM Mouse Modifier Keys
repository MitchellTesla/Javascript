A mouse event can be linked with the state of certain keyboard keys to determine the action to take.

The modifier keys Shift, Ctrl, Alt, and Meta are often used to alter the behavior of a mouse event.

The DOM specifies four properties to indicate the state of these modifier keys: shiftKey, ctrlKey, altKey, and metaKey.

Each of these properties contains a Boolean value that is set to true if the key is being held down or false if the key is not pressed.

When a mouse event occurs, you can determine the state of the various keys by inspecting these properties.

Consider the following example, which checks for modifier key state when a click event is fired:

Copy
let div = document.getElementById("myDiv");
div.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
    let keys = new Array();

    if (event.shiftKey) {
       keys.push("shift");
    }
    if (event.ctrlKey) {
       keys.push("ctrl");
    }

    if (event.altKey) {
       keys.push("alt");
    }

    if (event.metaKey) {
       keys.push("meta");
    }

    console.log("Keys: " + keys.join(","));
});
In this example, an onclick event handler checks the state of the various modifier keys.

The keys array contains the names of the modifier keys that are being held down.

For each property that is true, the name of the key is added to keys.

At the end of the event handler, the keys are displayed in a log message.

Modern browsers support all four keys.
