There are nine mouse events defined in DOM Level 3 Events.

They are as follows:

Event
Meaning
click

Fires when the user clicks the primary mouse button (the left button) or when the user presses the Enter key.
For accessibility purposes, because onclick event handlers can be executed using the keyboard and the mouse.
dblclick
Fires when the user double-clicks the primary mouse button (the left button).
mousedown
Fires when the user pushes any mouse button down.
mouseenter

Fires when the mouse cursor is outside of an element and then the user first moves it inside of the boundaries of the element.
This event does not bubble and does not fire when the cursor moves over descendant elements.
mouseleave

Fires when the mouse cursor is over an element and then the user moves it outside of that element's boundaries.
This event does not bubble and does not fire when the cursor moves over descendant elements.
mousemove

Fires repeatedly as the cursor is being moved around an element.
This event cannot be fired via the keyboard.
mouseout


Fires when the mouse cursor is over an element and then the user moves it over another element.
The element moved to may be outside of the bounds of the original element or a child of the original element.
This event cannot be fired via the keyboard.
mouseover

Fires when the mouse cursor is outside of an element and then the user first moves it inside of the boundaries of the element.
This event cannot be fired via the keyboard.
mouseup

Fires when the user releases a mouse button.
This event cannot be fired via the keyboard.
All elements on a page support mouse events.

All mouse events bubble except mouseenter and mouseleave, and they can all be canceled, which affects the default behavior of the browser.

Canceling the default behavior of mouse events can affect other events as well because of the relationship that exists amongst the events.

A click event can be fired only if a mousedown event is fired and followed by a mouseup event on the same element; if either mousedown or mouseup is canceled, then the click event will not fire.

Similarly, it takes two click events to cause the dblclick event to fire.

If anything prevents these two click events from firing by either canceling one of the click events or canceling either mousedown or mouseup, the dblclick event will not fire.

These four mouse events always fire in the following order:

mousedown
mouseup
click
mousedown
mouseup
click
dblclick
Both click and dblclick rely on other events to fire before they can fire, whereas mousedown and mouseup are not affected by other events.

The DOM Level 3 feature name is just MouseEvent instead of MouseEvents.

There is also a sub group of mouse events called wheel events.

Wheel events are really just a single event, mousewheel, which monitors interactions of a mouse wheel or a similar device such as the Mac track pad
