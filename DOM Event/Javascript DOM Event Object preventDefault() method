The preventDefault() method is used to prevent the default action of a particular event.

The default behavior of a link, for example, is to navigate to the URL specified in its href attribute when clicked.

If you want to prevent that navigation from occurring, an onclick event handler can cancel that behavior, as in the following example:

Copy
let link = document.getElementById("myLink");
link.onclick = function(event) {
 event.preventDefault();
};
Any event that can be canceled using preventDefault() will have its cancelable property set to true.
