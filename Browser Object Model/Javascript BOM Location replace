When the URL is changed in location object, an entry is made in the browser's history stack so the user may click the Back button to navigate to the previous page.

It is possible to disallow this behavior by using the replace() method.

This method accepts a single argument, the URL to navigate to, but does not make an entry in the history stack.

After calling replace(), the user cannot go back to the previous page.

Consider this example:

Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>You won't be able to get back here</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Enjoy this page for a second, because you won't be coming back here.</p>
  <script>
    setTimeout(() => location.replace("https://www.demo2s.com/"), 1000);
  </script>
</body>
</html>
If this page is loaded into a web browser, it will redirect to www.demo2s.com after a second.

At that point, the Back button will be disabled, and you won't be able to navigate back to this example page without typing in the complete URL again.
