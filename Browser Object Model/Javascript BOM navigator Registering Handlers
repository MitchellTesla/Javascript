Modern browsers formally support the registerProtocolHandler() method to the navigator object.

These methods allow a website to indicate that it can handle specific types of information.

We can handle protocols by using registerProtocolHandler(), which accepts three arguments:

the protocol to handle (i.e., "mailto" or "ftp"),
the URL of the page that handles the protocol, and
the name of the application.
For example, to register a web application as the default mail client, you can use the following:

Copy
navigator.registerProtocolHandler("mailto",
                                  "http://www.example.com?cmd=%s",
                                  "Some Mail Client");
In this example, a handler is registered for the mailto protocol, which will now point to a web-based e-mail client.

Once again, the second argument is the URL that should handle the request, and %s represents the original request.
