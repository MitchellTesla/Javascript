Example
Assure that the new window GETS focus and send the new window to the front:

Copy
let myWindow = window.open("", "", "width=200,height=100");
myWindow.document.write("<p>A new window!</p>");
myWindow.focus();

Description
The focus() method sets focus to the current window.

We can use the blur() method to remove focus from the current window.

This method makes a request to bring the current window to the foreground.

It may not work as you expect in all browsers, due to different user settings.
