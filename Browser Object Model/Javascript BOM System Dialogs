The Window object contains a set of methods for prompting the user in different ways.

The browser can invoke system dialogs to display to the user through the alert(), confirm(), and prompt() methods.

Name
Description
Returns
alert(<msg>)

Displays a dialog window to the user and waits for it to
be dismissed
void

confirm(<msg>)
Displays a dialog window with an OK/Cancel prompt
boolean
prompt(<msg>, <val>)
Displays a dialog prompting the user to enter a value
string
showModalDialog(<url>)
Displays a popup window showing the specified URL
void
These dialogs are not related to the web page being displayed in the browser and do not contain HTML.

Their appearance is determined by operating system and / or browser settings rather than CSS.

Additionally, each of these dialogs is synchronous and modal, meaning code execution stops when a dialog is displayed, and resumes after it has been dismissed.

Alert
The alert() method accepts a string to display to the user.

alert() expects only one argument.

When alert() is called, a system message box displays the specified text to the user, followed by a single OK button.

If alert() is passed an argument that is not a string primitive, it will coerce the argument into a string with its.toString() method.

Alert dialogs are typically used when users must be made aware of something that they have no control over, such as an error.

A user's only choice is to dismiss the dialog after reading the message.

Confirm
The second type of dialog is invoked by calling confirm().

A confirm dialog displays a message to the user.

A confirmation dialog has a Cancel button along with the OK button, which allows the user to indicate if a given action should be taken.

To determine if the user clicked OK or Cancel, the confirm() method returns a Boolean value: true if OK was clicked, or false if Cancel was clicked or the dialog box was closed by clicking the X in the corner.

Typical usage of a confirm dialog looks like this:

Copy
if (confirm("Are you sure?")) {
   console.log("yes");
} else {
   console.log("not sure.");
}
In this example, the confirm dialog is displayed to the user in the first line, which is a condition of the if statement.

Prompt
The final type of dialog is displayed by calling prompt(), which prompts the user for input.

Along with OK and Cancel buttons, this dialog has a text box where the user may enter some data.

The prompt() method accepts two arguments: the text to display to the user, and the default value for the text box. The default value can be an empty string.

If the OK button is clicked, prompt() returns the value in the text box; if Cancel is clicked or the dialog is otherwise closed without clicking OK, the function returns null.

Here's an example:

Copy
let result = prompt("What is your name? ", "");
if (result !== null) {
   console.log("Welcome, " + result);
}
These system dialogs can be helpful for displaying information to the user and asking for confirmation of decisions.

find and print
Two other types of dialogs can be displayed from JavaScript: find and print.

Both of these dialogs are displayed asynchronously, returning control to the script immediately.

The dialogs are the same as the ones the browser employs when the user selects either Find or Print from the browser's menu.

These are displayed using the find() and print() methods on the window object as follows:

Copy
// display print dialog
window.print();

// display find dialog
window.find();
These two methods give no indication as to whether the user has done anything with the dialog, so it is difficult to make good use of them.

Prompting the User.

Copy
let buttons = document.getElementsByTagName("button");
for (let i = 0 ; i < buttons.length; i++) {
    buttons[i].onclick = handleButtonPress;
}

function handleButtonPress(e) {
    if (e.target.id == "alert") {
        window.alert("This is an alert");
    } else if (e.target.id == "confirm") {
        let confirmed
           = window.confirm("This is a confirm - do you want to proceed?");
        alert("Confirmed? " + confirmed);
    } else if (e.target.id == "prompt") {
        let response = window.prompt("Enter a word", "hello");
        alert("The word was " + response);
    } else if (e.target.id == "modal") {
        window.showModalDialog("https://demo2s.com");
    }
}
