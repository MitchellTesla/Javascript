Changing various properties on the location object can also modify the currently loaded page.

The hash, search, hostname, pathname, and port properties can be set with new values that alter the current URL, as in this example:

Assume starting at https://www.demo2s.com/css/

changes URL to "https://www.demo2s.com/css/#section1"

Copy
location.hash = "#section1";
changes URL to "https://www.demo2s.com/css/?q=javascript"

Copy
location.search = "?q=javascript";
changes URL to "http://www.yahoo.com/css/"

Copy
location.hostname = "www.yahoo.com";
changes URL to "http://www.yahoo.com/my_dir/"

Copy
location.pathname = "my_dir";
changes URL to "http://www.yahoo.com:8080/css/"

Copy
Location.port = 8080;
Each time a property on location is changed, with the exception of hash, the page reloads with the new URL.

Changing the value of hash causes a new entry in the browser's history to be recorded.

Example
The simplest use for the document.location property is to get information about the location of the current object.

Using the Location Object to Get Information About the Document.

Copy
document.writeln("protocol: " + document.location.protocol);
document.writeln("host: " + document.location.host);
document.writeln("hostname: " + document.location.hostname);
document.writeln("port: " + document.location.port);
document.writeln("pathname: " + document.location.pathname);
document.writeln("search: " + document.location.search);
document.writeln("hash: " + document.location.hash);

The search property returns the query string portion of the URL, and the hash property returns the URL fragment.
