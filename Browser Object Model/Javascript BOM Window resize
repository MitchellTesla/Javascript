The browser window can be resized using the resizeTo() and resizeBy() methods.

Each method accepts two arguments: resizeTo() expects a new width and height, and resizeBy() expects the differences in each dimension.

resize to 100 x 100.

Copy
window.resizeTo(100, 100);
resize to 200 x 150.

Copy
window.resizeBy(100, 50);
resize to 300 x 300.

Copy
window.resizeTo(300, 300);
The resize methods may be disabled by the browser and are disabled by default in some browsers.

These methods apply only to the topmost window object.
