The top object always points to the very top outer most window, which is the browser window itself.

Another window object is called parent.

The parent object always points to the current window's immediate parent window.

For the top most browser window, parent is equal to top and both are equal to window.

The top most window has no value name unless the window was opened using window.open().

window property self always points to window.

We can chain window objects together, such as window.parent.parent.
