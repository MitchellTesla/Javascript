The document.location property returns a Location object that gives you fine-grained information about the document's address and allows you to navigate to other documents.

BOM location object provides information about the document that is currently loaded in the window, as well as general navigation functionality.

The location object is a property of both window and document; both window.location and document.location point to the same object.

The location object knows about the currently loaded document, and it also parses the URL into discrete segments that can be accessed via a series of properties.

The following table describes the functions and properties of the Location object.
