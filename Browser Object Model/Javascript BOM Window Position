The position of a window object can be retrieved and changed using various properties and methods.

Modern browsers all provide screenLeft and screenTop properties that indicate the window's location in relation to the left and top of the screen, respectively, in CSS pixels.

We can move the window to a new position using the moveTo() and moveBy() methods.

Each method accepts two arguments.

moveTo() expects the x and y coordinates to move to an absolute coordinate, and moveBy() expects the number of pixels to move relative to the current coordinate.

These methods are demonstrated here:

move the window to the upper-left coordinate

Copy
window.moveTo(0,0);
move the window down by 100 pixels

Copy
window.moveBy(0, 100);
move the window to position (200, 300).

Copy
window.moveTo(200, 300);
move the window left by 50 pixels.

Copy
window.moveBy(-50, 0);
Depending on the browser, these methods may be conditionally or completely disabled.
