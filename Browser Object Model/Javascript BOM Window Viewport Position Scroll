We can scroll around the document with a limited viewport inside window.

The CSS pixel offset of the current viewport is available as an X and Y pair, representing the number of pixels the viewport is currently scrolled in that direction.

The X and Y offsets are each accessible via two properties, which return identical values: window.pageXoffset / window.scrollX, and window.pageYoffset / window.scrollY.

We can scroll the page by a certain amount using several different window methods.

These methods are passed two coordinates indicating how far in the X and Y direction the viewport should scroll.window.scroll(x, y) will scroll the viewport by a relative amount.

window.scrollBy(x, y) behaves identically.

window.scrollTo(x, y) scrolls the viewport to an absolute offset.

Scroll down 100px relative to the current viewport.

Copy
window.scroll(0, 100);
Scroll right 40px relative to the current viewport.

Copy
Window.scroll(40, 0);
Scroll to the top left corner of the page.

Copy
window.scrollTo(0, 0);
Scroll to 100px from the top and left of the page.

Copy
window.scrollTo(100, 100);
These methods also accept a ScrollToOptions dictionary, which in addition to holding the offset values can instruct the browser to smooth the scroll via the behavior property.

normal scroll.

Copy
window.scrollTo({
  left: 100,
  top: 100,
  behavior: 'auto'
 });
smooth scroll.
