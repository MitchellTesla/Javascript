Regular expressions test() accepts a string argument and returns true if the pattern matches the argument and false if it does not.

We can use it test if a pattern is matched without needing the actual matched text.

The test() method is often used in if statements, such as the following:

Copy
let text = "000-00-0000";
let pattern = /\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}/;

if (pattern.test(text)) {
  console.log("The pattern was matched.");
}
In this example, the regular expression tests for a specific numeric sequence.

If the input text matches the pattern, then a message is displayed.
