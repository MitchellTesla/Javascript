Do a global search for "is" in a string, and output the index after a match is found:

Copy
let str = "This is a Test is this is a test";
let patt1 = /is/g;

while (patt1.test(str)==true)  {
  console.log("Index now at: "+patt1.lastIndex);
}
Output:


Description
The lastIndex property specifies the index where to start the next match.

This property only works if the "g" modifier is set.

This property returns an integer that specifies the character position immediately after the last match found by exec() or test() methods.

exec( ) and test( ) reset lastIndex to 0 if they do not get a match.
