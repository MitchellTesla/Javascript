All metacharacters must be double-escaped, as must characters that are already escaped, such as \n.

The \ character, which is normally escaped in strings as \\ becomes \\\\ when used in a regular-expression string.

The following table shows some patterns in their literal form and the equivalent string that would be necessary to use the RegExp constructor.

Literal Pattern
String Equivalent
/\[bc\]at/
"\\[bc\\]at"
/\.at/
"\\.at"
/name\/age/
"name\\/age"
/\d.\d{1,2}/
"\\d.\\d{1,2}"
/\w\\hello\\123/
"\\w\\\\hello\\\\123"
